I\'ve been using my own hand-rolled software for years and so far its worked out ok. On the plus side it keeps me in deep with various of the latest blog technologies, having to hand-roll them myself. As I wrote on a <a href=\"http://www.launch21.com/2007/02/11/the-pain-of-updating-the-web-site/\">post over on the new Launch21 blog, the lack of good tools to post</a> make it harder for me to update things frequently and it is just not worth it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.launch21.com/\">Launch21.com</a> is running on WordPress now, but it will probably take a bit longer to move this site there since I\'ll want to preserve pretty much all of the old URLs for search engines. Hopefully not too long.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://mattishness.blogspot.com/\">Matt from Judy\'s book finally started writing a blog</a> and is off to a quick start with a flurry of interesting posts. I\'m always a fan of interesting discussions about how to balance innovation, execution, etc. There was an interesting talk at the Northwest Entrepreneurs Forum by Shaun Wolfe, CEO of MessageGate. He called execution \"system\" and talked about a classic triangle balancing time, system, and innovation. One of his key messages was that its really key for a startup to understand when is the right time to invest in system (process, infrastructure, global scaling, reducing costs, more predictability), given the inevitable impact that has on innovation and rapid development.\r\n\r\nOn another random topic, Eric asked about what would be a good video card to drive his new Plasma TV nicely and I pointed him to this <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/showdoc.aspx?i=2874&p=\">AnandTech article on HDMI/HDCP capable\r\nvideo cards</a>. For a \"TV\" you want to find something that supports an HDMI connector at 1080P to get the best results, and ideally that supports the crappy HDCP copy protection stuff so you can play high-def video content.','Technology- Moving to WordPress soon',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-moving-to-wordpress-soon','','\nhttp://www.launch21.com/2007/02/11/the-pain-of-updating-the-web-site/','2007-02-19 09:30:34','2007-02-19 14:30:34','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=4',0,'post','',0),(5,1,'2007-02-08 00:00:00','2007-02-08 05:00:00','<a href=\"http://www.naffziger.net/blog/2007/02/07/is-the-semantic-web-web-30-dead-on-arrival/\">Dave asks\r\n\"Is the Semantic Web (Web 3.0) Dead on Arrival?\"</a> over on his blog. This reminds me a bit of some of the stuff I was trying to get at when <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/article%202006-06-22.htm?c=h\">I wrote about the history of RSS</a>, although as usual my writing approach was the boring one and Dave did a great job coming out with an attention grabbing headline.\r\n\r\nSome of the general concepts of the Semantic web are great, but the presentations I\'d seen never included compelling user scenarios that made me really want to get it. In terms of the Vista marketing, there was no \"wow\" moment. Furthermore the technical approach was very dry, complicated and impractical.\r\n\r\nMicroformats and some of the other current trends on the web are a much more reasonable way to go about this kind of thing. Strip down complexity, make it work with the existing infrastucture and let people wire it together. The W3C vision around RDF and whatnot requried people to adjust how they expressed all their data, build new query engines, new outputs of their data from their apps. Ironically for a thing called the Semantic web, it required you to strip the semantics out of your data. From an architectural point of view there are good arguments for this seperation of data and semantics, but it rarely fit in well with any web-sites business strategy.\r\n\r\nIn other news the new <a href=\"http://www.blocparty.com/\">Bloc Party</a> <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com/album/11000/11000945.html\">album, A Weekend in the City</a> is out and its available on eMusic immediately. This is a huge score for eMusic and it seems like they would be crazy to not sponsor (or otherwise have a presence at) the Bloc Party tour this spring. I see that they do have a big animated add for the album on their homepage, so it is clear that they get what a big deal this is for them. Of course Bloc Party\'s own web-site advertises downloading it from iTunes complete with evil DRM that Steve Jobs, despite his letter yesterday, hasn\'t removed. Given that Bloc Party obviously allows non-DRM protected distribution of thier stuff, this would be a good \"put up or shut up\" for Mr. Jobs.','Technology- Semantic Web and Microformats',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-semantic-web-and-microformats','','\nhttp://www.naffziger.net/blog/2007/02/07/is-the-semantic-web-web-30-dead-on-arrival/','2007-02-19 10:52:56','2007-02-19 15:52:56','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=5',0,'post','',0),(6,1,'2007-02-06 00:00:00','2007-02-06 05:00:00','Many blogs have referenced <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughtsonmusic/\">Steve Job\'s Thoughts on Music</a> post today. While it is absolutely true that this is a propaganda statement in his battle with EU regulators, and that Steve\'s business is benefiting greatly from DRM right now, it doesn\'t matter. The fact that he came out and said this so clearly in public hopefully will help turn the tide away from DRM. Bill Gates in effect said something similar a few weeks ago when chatting with some bloggers but not in as public a way and certainly not as clearly.\r\n\r\nFor now I\'m going to continue to support <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com/\">eMusic</a> as much as possible as a great place to get DRM-free music. Some quick research shows that I can find over 30 of the bands playing at Coachella there so I\'m well on my way downloading an album or two from each to decide what I want to go see. I\'ve heard that other services are experimenting with DRM free music and if they do I\'ll be eager to support them too.','Technology- DRM and Apple',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-drm-and-apple','','','2007-02-19 10:53:08','2007-02-19 15:53:08','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=6',0,'post','',0),(7,1,'2007-02-01 00:00:00','2007-02-01 05:00:00','<div>A new build of WPF/E is now available from here (<a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/e/e/5eeb4dcb-eba5-4e67-8705-48d954df3270/install.msi\">Windows</a>, <a href=\"http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/e/3/5e34f0fb-254a-4b94-8fbc-0814513e1f9c/WPFe.dmg\">Mac</a>).

He talks about the early days of DHTML and Ajax and some of the Slashdot comments have picked up on his talking about having invented Ajax and\r\nsuggested this conflicts with my <a href=\"http://staging.alexhopmann.com/\">Story of XMLHTTP</a> write up that has been carried in many online outlets lately.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I\'ll weigh in and say that both are true. To the extent that there is some confusion its because what we call AJAX today is a collection of many things- The basic dynamic\r\nHTML infrastructure. The XMLHTTP & async network communication piece. And the patterns of tying it all together.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Adam and his team (especially folks like Rod Chavez, <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=186137\">Michael Wallent</a> and many others, as usual I\'m probably forgetting to mention some of the key people) invented\r\nthe Dynamic HTML part which was miles beyond what Netscape was doing at the time. I just filled in the XMLHTTP piece, and collaborated with many others to do the first major app that tied it together (Outlook Web Access). Without the earlier contributions of the Trident/IE teams, it wouldn\'t have been possible, and its absolutely true that Adam and many folks he worked with had the conceptual vision for tying it together (he called it weblications at the time).</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Having said that, they never built a real app with it and the act of using it for real turned up some missing pieces, leading to XMLHTTP as well as several other things that the Trident and XML teams themselves pioneered. I\'d also like to acknowledge the Adaptive Path guys for coming up with a nice description of the approach and giving it a word that wraps it up nicely (Ajax). At Microsoft we totally blew the opportunity to evangelize and get out in front of this approach back in 1999. That itself is a longer story for sometime in the future. I realize that some in the technical community are \"all about the engineering\" but effective marketing and\r\ncommunication of your ideas is important and we missed out on that.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>I do also think that Adam\'s discussion of why Ajax didn\'t take off in 1997 misses a key point. Sure, network connections were too slow at the time. The computers themselves and Javascript was too slow (recall that typical machines were 200mhz). The earliest versions of DHTML in IE4 had some.. er.. issues to work out (there was more than one reason that OWA required later versions of the browser). But most importantly I just don\'t think its realistic to expect the development community to make sweeping shifts to some new technology quickly. As I\'ve mentioned before these things take 3-5 years, so its not much of a surprise that the stuff that was developed incrementally between 1996 and 1998 actually started to hit it big in 2000-2002 and really exploded in 2005-2006.</div>\r\n\r\n','Technology- Adam Bosworth on early days of DHTML',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-adam-bosworth-on-early-days-of-dhtml','','','2007-03-01 18:24:27','2007-03-02 02:24:27','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=8',0,'post','',0),(9,1,'2007-01-22 00:00:00','2007-01-22 05:00:00','The <a href=\"http://www.coachella.com/\">Coachella 2007 line up is out</a>.

I sit here wondering\r\nif saying thank you for a link makes me not cool. Kind of like the person who is over star-struck meeting a famous person or something. Personally\r\nI\'m not terribly fond of the automated trackbacks (plus, spam has limited their usefulness) and it\'s the interconnectedness that makes the web work so I\'m\r\ngoing to do it anyway. Thank you Dion!\r\n\r\nThe combination of the new interest in that write up and a conversation with a client yesterday of course reminds me of another good story. As we\r\nwere developing Exchange 2000 / Outlook Web Access we would meet with Bob Muglia pretty much every week. At the time Bob was our senior VP and was\r\nrunning a pretty huge organization (I think including all of Office). The amazing thing was that despite the size of his organization he managed to\r\nstill be very involved. Execs that combined the ability to get it when they saw something important and at the same time inspire people to drive\r\nhard made that a very exciting place to work.\r\n\r\nOutlook Web Access was very much a \"catch up\" project. We started about halfway through Exchange 2000, and were working very quickly to build as\r\nmuch functionality as possible. Outlook has an incredibly deep feature set including tasks, this thing called the Journal, and of course tons of\r\ncontacts and calendar features. At this point we had gotten the basic mail part working but not much else.\r\n\r\nI don\'t know how he pulled it off, but when we showed Bob a demo of the mail stuff, he managed to do this really cool thing. He managed to show\r\nhow enthusiastic he was about what we had pulled off so far. And at the same time somehow he challenged us something along the lines of \"of course\r\ncontacts are hard, you probably can\'t have contacts working quickly\". The next week we demoed the contact list and again, he was enthusiastic, but of\r\ncourse the \"card\" view would be tricky. We managed to go for quite some time and every week Jim and Bob somehow managed to pull off a whole major\r\nsection of the application into good enough shape for me to demo it.\r\n\r\nI\'m pretty sure that Bob and Gord Mangione (our GM) knew the difference between getting something to the point where you can demo it vs. shipping\r\nto enterprise customers. Getting this stuff polished and out the door was a huge effort and considerably less glamorous than those rapid development\r\ndays, but I don\'t think we would have made it to there without the special kind of encouragement we had at the outset. There is a special balance\r\nyou need to strike as a manager to create the right atmosphere so that people feel challenged but not overburdened.\r\n\r\nToo often the relationship between a development team and their management is some adversarial one where the development team feels\r\nthey need to push back on schedules and challenges. I think one of the sources of this problem rests in our assumptions that software\r\nlike other engineering disciplines should be something you can accurately schedule. Developers that can come in on time are thought of\r\nas more professional. Plus, I get how difficult it can be to plan a marketing launch or other business issues that need lots of advance\r\nnotice when your developers can\'t predict how long it will take to finish.\r\n\r\nThe sad fact is that as a developer I really dislike being pushed to make an accurate estimate of how long a project is going to take,\r\nand as a program manager I dislike having to push my development team for accurate estimates. It takes the right developers, but if your\r\nbusiness and team can support it, you can get lots more done by not having a fixed schedule, tackling projects incrementally with nice\r\nbite sized steps, and just driving hard to get them done as quickly as possible.

It will be interesting to observe how much traffic a popular blog with great Google rankings like his creates. Given that good links are the currency of the web, I owe Dare a big thank you. And of course for any new visitors today, welcome.\r\n\r\nThe funny thing is that my first reaction was to be a bit stressed out. XmlHttp itself was a fairly small\r\nproject as such things go, but even the smallest things at Microsoft need the contributions of so many people to pull them off. I\'m confident that I forgot to mention many important people who helped and I hope they aren\'t too offended.\r\n\r\nOutlook Web Access for Exchange 2000 was in many ways a much bigger accomplishment and of course the acknowledgement list for that project would have to be much much longer. XmlHTTP was just one small missing piece that helped pull off what is now called the Ajax architecture, but OWA is the place where the techniques to use it and to really build rich applications in the web browser really came together.\r\n\r\nOne interesting story- while we were developing Outlook Web Access for Exchange 2000, we were stressed that the rich version only worked for IE5 which had just barely shipped and was not widely deployed, especially in enterprise. We had an HTML 3.2 version that could run with any web-browser, but we not sure about the reaction we would get from our top customers to the IE5 requirement for the best experience. One thing that I thought was great about working in the Exchange team was that I had lots of opportunity to present to these big enterprise customers and meet with their CIOs and top Exchange administrators in person. These guys surprised us- I probably did a couple of dozen presentations to these guys and never once did I get any pushback on the IE5 thing. The more common reaction was that they saw so much value in having a server-driven app like Outlook Web Access that they said they were going to push up IE5 deployments to make sure all of their employees could access it. It does go to show that when you build a compelling platform and show the specific\r\nbusiness justification, the deployment happens easily, and the IE and Trident teams deserve a ton of credit for having stuck with that vision for dynamic HTML applications for such a long time.','General- Blog Posts and Giving Proper Credit',0,'','publish','open','open','','general-blog-posts-and-giving-proper-credit','','','2007-02-19 10:50:23','2007-02-19 15:50:23','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=11',0,'post','',0),(12,1,'2007-01-09 00:00:00','2007-01-09 05:00:00','It is pretty amazing to me the sorry state of the TV networks taking advantage of the Internet as a distribution\r\nmedium. The only real excuse is that most people don\'t have a computer hooked up to a TV yet so they can\'t really\r\nwatch TV programming sent via their computer. Still, with a set of early adopters all over it, you would think someone\r\nwould get in front of this trend.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So far the best solution I\'ve found is Amazon Unbox. Unbox is cool enough that I\'m planning on cancelling\r\nsome of the premium channels on cable and just getting individual programs via Unbox. While I felt that $2 per\r\nprogram was too much for TV (its still too much for 30min programs, they need to price differentiate more), \r\nwhen I look at how many programs I can buy a month and still save over the Comcast\r\nsubscription, it becomes easier to justify. Plus I get real DVD quality content, better than most broadcast HD\r\nand I get to replay anytime at that quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The other night we went to watch the latest CSI episode and discovered that the recorded version was trash. Somewhere\r\nbetween the Media Center and the HD broadcast antenna the results were jumpy and cut out. Since CSI is one of the programs\r\navailable on Unbox I went there to get the program. This was a day after the broadcast but the new episode wasn\'t online\r\nyet. This I really don\'t get- hey, if I\'m paying $2 to watch it, they should pretty much have it available online\r\nbefore the normal broadcast time if anything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However a quick visit to the CBS web-site saved me. They have this new <a href=\"http://www.cbs.com/innertube/player.php?cat=113814\">video player they call the InnerTube</a>\r\nthat has full episodes of most of the shows available a couple of hours after the west-coast air time. They\r\nforce you to watch a couple of ads, but thankfully they are fairly brief (although they crank up the volume even\r\nworse than normal broadcast ads do).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality isn\'t as good as Amazon but its almost as good as broadcast/cable after you PVR it.\r\nHopefully this is a sign of good things to come. Now if someone had a $20/month\r\nsubscription service that would give me all the HD quality video of TV shows I want...</p>\r\n\r\n','TV- CBS Making Progress',0,'','publish','open','open','','tv-cbs-making-progress','','','2007-02-24 01:20:54','2007-02-24 09:20:54','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=12',0,'post','',0),(13,1,'2006-12-28 00:00:00','2006-12-28 05:00:00','<div>With the consumer release of Vista coming out in a few weeks I\'ve been playing with RC2 and thought I\'d document some of my experiences and tips for Vista users.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>My first time is to suggest turning User Account Control off.

This was an ambitious effort to fix some of the system fragility problems with the registry and dll-hell on Windows. The result can only be described as a fix that is 10x worse that the problem. The registry certainly has its problems, and most developers had figured out how to rename DLLs with strange version #s when they made incompatible changes. Things were fragile but a reasonably skilled Windows power-user or developer could fix them. With fusion the model is so much more complex and the databases are more opaque so pretty much the only people who can fix problems are the developers on the Fusion team. Its incredibly easy to get the wrong thing in the GAC (global assembly\r\ncache) or otherwise make some minor configuration mistake that is almost impossible to fix.\r\n\r\nWho knows, maybe this is a product opportunity.

Now that we have the deals site up and running solidly it has been very cool to succesfully build and ship some new features in less than a week.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>A couple of weeks ago Chad and I built a <a href=\"http://deals.judysbook.com/coupons\">Coupon Finder</a> that uses a little bit of AJAX to work somewhat like the Google Suggest feature. You just start typing a phrase and as you type it issues queries and updates the display in real-time. The key was keeping the results really compact and the queries light-weight enough that the performance is really good. If it were slower at returning the results the usability would be poor. As it is the feature feels (to me) cool and responsive.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>That same week we shipped a <a href=\"http://deals.judysbook.com/holiday/holidayshipping\">Holiday shipping guide</a>.\r\nThis was pretty crucial to turn around quickly while the data was still useful to people. Getting it out the door was an interesting exercise in rapid development. It was a mostly content-oriented mini-site, but the data entry was turning out to be very error-prone. We switched it to be driven by a table of data and were succesful at getting the initial version out on time, but there were issues to fix for a few days after the initial launch. From my perspective that was fine- with a web app if its not horribly broken, the cost of doing updates should be fairly low and there is little evidence of your mistakes later.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Yesterday we got online a <a href=\"http://deals.judysbook.com/christmassale\">After Christmas Sale Guide</a> that was built on a similar structure to the holiday shipping guide. Based on the experience with the first guide I built a structure for creating generic \"guide\" sites. It seems like these things are very useful to people who visit the deals site, and they also provide a good source of incoming organic search users. In theory this generic version will let us deploy a new guide by editing an Excel file, three lines in a config file and no real code. If I had tried to build the generic version before we did the first guide I\'m pretty certain I would have screwed it up- either made it too complicated or created a structure that didn\'t provide us with the right flexibility. Since we worked out the model in the first place, and then encapsulated it into code later, I had an easy model to follow. Of course I\'m sure there will be many additions for future versions, but from my perspective it was a pretty good validation about rapid iterative models of software development.</div>\r\n\r\n','Technology- Judy\'s Book After Christmas Guide',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-judys-book-after-christmas-guide','','','2007-03-01 18:25:35','2007-03-02 02:25:35','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=16',0,'post','',0),(17,1,'2006-12-21 00:00:00','2006-12-21 05:00:00','<div>For the past few months I\'ve been both working on some of my own sites like <a href=\"http://www.calendardata.com\">CalendarData</a> as well as working with some other start-ups like <a href=\"http://www.judysbook.com\">Judy\'s Book</a>.

All that I can say is that having the power off\r\nwas miserable. I can\'t imagine how horrible it must be for people who still don\'t have power now that\r\nthe work week has started. At least we didn\'t run out of laundry and were able to go to the gym for a hot\r\nshower.\r\n\r\nIt is pretty incredibly how poor the information availability was during the past week. Back at the 2003 PDC\r\nwe did all kinds of demos of cool visualizations for situation-rooms and emergency response centers. But we never\r\nmentioned anything about helping provide information to people so they can find out what is going on. I\'m sure\r\nthere are kinds of social issues involved with providing more detailed information (why is that block prioritized ahead\r\nof mine?) but it still seems like we could do much better.\r\n\r\nWith my server running nicely in its rack in the datacenter, I thought I\'d mention how great of a change\r\nit is to have modern virtualization technology. This is one of those things that took a bit to sink in. It was pretty\r\nclear right away why it was cool to have virtual memory and preemptive multi-tasking back a couple of decades ago. But\r\nwhen I can run all my apps at once nicely in one OS, why would I care about running more than one OS?\r\n\r\nBut with just 1U of space in the datacenter, the flexibility that virtualization gives me is just really amazing.\r\nThe machine I got can easily expand to more than 10GB ram, 8 cores of CPUs, and 3TB of disks space. Those upgrades\r\nare all much easier than buying an extra hardware box. And eventually I\'m sure I will buy an extra piece of hardware\r\nfor redundancy. But in the meantime I can setup the services I\'m building, deploy them on their own virtual\r\nmachines, and they are all easy to manage. System updates used to be scary for a server when you don\'t have physical\r\naccess, since if the machine didn\'t reboot right, you weren\'t there to reset it. Now if I need to reset a \"machine\"\r\nI just log into the host machine and go to its console.\r\n\r\nOnce I have a second server, I don\'t need to do any complicated reconfiguration. I can just move some of the\r\nVM configurations to the new box, and start them up. I didn\'t even have to shut-down my app servers to bring\r\nthe physical hardware to the data center- they were all suspended, and once I booted up the host they were all\r\nable to just resume. I could be wrong but it looks like reboot times might be much easier to manage and\r\nmuch quicker with this setup too.\r\n\r\nThis stuff is going to be industry-changing for sure. Its already taking off quite a bit, but its clear\r\nthat within a couple of years its going to be ubiquitous. On the other hand, Microsoft\'s current licensing schemes seem\r\nlike they are going to be a serious problem. Just dealing with product activation already puts Windows Server\r\nat a huge disadvantage in this kind of world where its trivially easy to just clone a Linux machine image\r\nbut Windows Server puts me through many more hoops to get it to work. Microsoft is going to have to figure\r\nout how to charge (and not gouge) for this stuff without being too much of a nightmare for the administrator.\r\nIf they don\'t their already precarious position in the server space is going to collapse.','Technology- Virtualization',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-virtualization','','','2007-02-17 20:00:11','2007-02-18 01:00:11','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=18',0,'post','',0),(19,1,'2006-12-16 00:00:00','2006-12-16 05:00:00','Thursday night we had a huge wind storm here in Seattle and the power has been out in our neighborhood for\na day and a half now.

One of the nice aspects is the install is smaller, and it runs on Macs, etc. But it doesn\'t \r\nappear to use the same high fidelity text engine and all that that the full WPF does. The real WPF isn\'t a strict superset of WPF/E, to run without the CLR and on other platforms I suspect that its actually a completely different implementation. It would be nice if, on machines where full WPF exists you automatically got the benefits of full WPF, and the WPF/E engine only ran when its not there.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>But I guess this brings us to one of the slightly confusing parts of the wonderful Microsoft technology naming. WPF/E isn\'t really that similar to WPF. It\'s a different engine, a different runtime model, etc. Hopefully they share some of the same rendering code, but mostly from a programming point of view the only thing they share is the ability to specify things in XAML. Even there, you window up using the http://schemas.microsoft.com/client/2007 namespace for WPF/E and the http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml namespace for WPF (and some of the later namespace is used for WPF/E also).</div>\r\n\r\n<div>What this means is that you can create a XAML file for WPF/E. Double click it in the explorer and it will open in IE, and WPF will try to render it, but fail. Presumably this is a minor inconsistency that Microsoft can fix (although its not clear if that can be fixed in the final 1.0 version of WPF/E or if it needs to wait for a new version of .NET or if its just something you can work around in authoring your XAML).</div>\r\n\r\n<div>It is clear that it is still early days for this stuff. WPF/E doesn\'t even have a textbox yet. Presumably that is a key thing for them to add before they ship version 1. In the end I\'m <b>VERY</b> glad that Microsoft choose to get this out into the community so we could start working with it at such an early stage- it looks like yet another sign of a more responsive Microsoft.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>On another front, I\'d point out that the support for media that is in the existing build is critical. So many of the scenarios where people want to embed richer content involve media, and this is one of the most common uses of flash around the web.

One of the more disappointing things about leaving in 2005 is that the things I\'d been working\non where not ready for prime time yet, and it would be years before it would make sense to really dive in\nagain for real-world projects. The other issue is just that the size of the platform (huge download) and\nbig app model changes (Avalon/WPF is mostly code-first so existing web-sites would need to be really rethought\nto adopt it.</p>\n\n<p>Yesterday Microsoft put the community preview of WPF/E (E is for Everywhere). They took the core graphics\nconcepts of Avalon, the XAML language and packaged it in a 1MB download, with an object model designed to work\ninside web pages and be programmed from Javascript. Even better it works in Firefox and on the Mac. This is a huge\nbreakthrough- a 1MB download really isn\'t that big of a deal and the broad platform support (hopefully Linux?)\nand consistent programming model makes it way easier to buy in to the technology.</p>\n\n<p>Without further delay, here is my first \"Hello World\" thing in WPF/E.

We often talked about ideas like imagining thanksgiving as an Asian holiday.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Last year we tried to do thanksgiving as a small plates meal. Overall I\'d call it a disaster. Some of the dishes worked out ok, some failed (truffle mini-souffles) and the many-courses of small plates format kept a bunch of us psycho busy in the kitchen the whole night.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>This year Michael agreed to host Thanksgiving and in the end almost 50 people were invited. With that many people we needed some good coordination and we had an opportunity to do both traditional versions of many dishes as well as jazzing things up a little bit. We did three turkeys- one traditional roasted, one deep friend, and my experiment for this year was a Peking Turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basically the idea was to cook a turkey using the techniques normally applied to Peking duck. Part of the motivation was some less than stellar skin on previous turkeys. Since Peking duck is known for its great crispy skin I wondered if the approach would work on a turkey.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The basic notion is to dry out the turkey and then baste it with some flavored boiling water for 10 minutes. This seals the skin and helps keep the juices in when you cook it. Then you hang it for 8 hours with a fan on it and brush it with a honey-water mix every couple of hours. Then you roast it fairly conventionally. The skin browned fairly quickly, so make sure to cover it in foil and turn down the heat once it browns.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall I think it worked out very well and I\'d be tempted to try it again. The usual duck recipes tell you to remove the leg bones and I should have followed that- when the turkey was hung the blood all accumulated in the drumsticks and couldnt really drain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hillel wrote up some of <a href=\"http://www.tastingmenu.com/archive/2006/11-november/20061126.htm\">the meal here on tastingmenu with some pictures</a>. One other observation- I think the class we took at the CIA was some pretty good prep for an event like this. Cooking for 50 can be pretty hectic and we had it mostly all prepped and ready to go with only reasonable amount of work on Thanksgiving afternoon itself.</p>\r\n\r\n','Cooking- Peking Turkey',0,'','publish','open','open','','cooking-peking-turkey','','','2007-03-03 23:09:46','2007-03-04 07:09:46','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=24',0,'post','',0),(25,1,'2006-12-03 00:00:00','2006-12-03 05:00:00','Two pieces of good news Via <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/12/spinvox_now_all.html\">Guy Kawasaki\'s latest post</a>.

It has always felt like this huge disruptive context switch for me to\ngo listen to some messages, make sure I have someplace to take notes, and all that. I\'m much happier communicating\nin email, IM, or in-person meetings that by telephones and voice-mail, but of course I need to be able to adapt\nto how other people what to communicate also.</p>\n\n<p>First of all its incredibly stupid that I can\'t get my Verizon cell-phone voicemail delivered to my email inbox\nas voice attachments. Email systems like Exchange have had this capability for at least 6 or 7 years and really it shouldn\'t be hard at all to just configure the voice-mail system to send me an email. But the SpinVox goes a step further and translates the voice message to text. From my perspective this is perfect since everyone can operate in the medium\nthat they prefer and still get along just fine.</p>\n\n]]&gt;','General- Good news from the UK',0,'','publish','open','open','','general-good-news-from-the-uk','','','2006-12-03 00:00:00','2006-12-03 05:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=25',0,'post','',0),(26,1,'2006-11-28 00:00:00','2006-11-28 05:00:00','Last week I got my new MacBook. It has been exactly 10 years since I last bought a Mac, just after I joined Microsoft in November 1996.</p>\n\n<p>From 1984 through 1995 I was primarily a Mac developer. In the mid 90s the combination of the stagnation of the Mac platform (at that time) and the new stable Windows NT operating system brought me over to the Windows world. I was writing cross-platform software, but at the time I needed to reboot my Mac every time my application crashed, and Windows could just restart the process and keep going. As a developer you do that a lot so I started using the Windows machine more and more and eventually had little reason to keep using a Mac at all.</p>\n\n<p>This year the situation has changed quite a bit. Im working on my own projects and would like to make sure that the web stuff works well with the Safari browser on the Mac. The Mac also has this application iCal which can sync calendars from a web-site and I want to make sure it works well with <a href=\"http://www.calendardata.com/\">CalendarData.com</a>.</p>\n\n<p>But even more importantly, the switch to the Intel chips, something the Mac faithful had been speculating about for years, has made a huge difference in the practicality of using a Mac. My new MacBook is a <i>GREAT</i> Windows laptop. But best of all, with one key-press I can switch between the Mac OS, Windows Vista, and Linux and back to the Mac OS. Using the Parallels virtual machine software this laptop gives me the ultimate flexibility which is just a huge advantage.</p>\n\n<p>After ten years away from the platform my Mac skills have gotten very rusty. As I usually do Ill be posting my discoveries on here as I play with new utilities and all that fun stuff.

This more or less makes fun of just how complex SOAP turned out to be with all its layers of XML schema, options, and other such mess. The general point is dead on and I\'ve been a big fan of simpler REST-style mechanisms for wiring things up. The SOAP stuff works great when you stick with a single vendors tool-kit, especially just cranking it all out in Visual Studio, but wiring up dissimilar platforms is still a mess.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Pete\'s post points out that SOAP doesn\'t really use HTTP and mostly just tunnels through it. It doesn\'t put anything meaningful in the URL or use HTTP response codes in a meaningful way. He then points out that the SOAPAction HTTP header is mysterious and no one knows what it is for.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>If I remember things correctly, SOAPAction is at least partly my fault. During the era when SOAP was being developed there were several different faction inside Microsoft involved with Internet protocol stuff. The faction that I was more associated with was more directly involved in the development of HTTP and HTTP extensions like WebDAV while another set of people had come from an RPC background and were developing SOAP. To be fair this was a classic case of a couple of groups of people by in large trying to work with each other, but not taking the time to really understand the other groups view-points, perspectives and expertise, and this was probably worse on the HTTP-fan side.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>In any case, we were working with the SOAP guys to try to make SOAP more integrated with HTTP rather than just tunneling through it. HTTP has mechanisms of namespace, feature negotiation, authentication, error reporting and more, none of which SOAP used. On the other hand the SOAP guys were just trying to build their SOAP features and figuring out how to interact with all this HTTP stuff seemed like it was just going to delay them, plus it would make it harder to apply SOAP over other infrastructures (not that I\'ve heard of anyone doing SOAP over SMTP or anything in real-life).</div>\r\n\r\n<div>So we were left with trying to come up with practical arguments with why SOAP needed to follow more HTTP rules to be successful in the marketplace. For better or worse the only argument we really came up with was that HTTP protocols often have to go through HTTP proxy servers to get in and out of firewalls. By simply tunneling everything we pointed out that the administrators of those firewalls might lock down the traffic and not be able to differentiate between SOAP traffic, web-browser form submissions, etc. We didn\'t want the proxy to have to parse all the XML in the request to tell what was happening.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Initially we were asking for SOAP to be handled over a different method from POST. Our argument was that HTTP methods were the extensibility mechanism for HTTP protocol stuff and since POST had another function, it was not appropriate to reuse it for a very different type of thing. The counter-argument was that there were various HTTP stacks and proxies that didn\'t handle methods other than the built-in ones and by using a different method we would limit the reach of the protocol. The compromise was the SOAPAction header which a proxy could use to tell the difference between normal web-browser form submission and SOAP traffic, and differenetiate\r\nbetween different types of SOAP requests. In theory this would give the administrators some needed control of their firewalls.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>Cue forward a few years, and it was probably a mistake. I haven\'t heard of anyone using it for anything useful and it just creates extra complexity and another thing to get wrong trying to interoperate between different implementations.</div>\r\n\r\n<div>One last note- the Internet community has a long history of slapping the \"Simple\" term on things more as wishful thinking than reality.</div>\r\n\r\n','Technology- SOAP and S is for Simple',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-soap-and-s-is-for-simple','','','2007-03-01 18:37:37','2007-03-02 02:37:37','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=27',0,'post','',0),(28,1,'2006-11-10 00:00:00','2006-11-10 05:00:00','The last two times I asked a question on here the result was so succesful I figure I may as well try it again.</p>\n\n<p>One of the most common scenarios for querying a database is a paged result, either in a\nrich-client listbox scenario, or in a web-page where it shows you page x of Y. MySql has this cool syntax \nwhere you can do something like:</p>\n\n<pre>SELECT * from xxx LIMIT 500,10</pre>\n\n<p>Which means give me lines 500-509 of the resultset I\'m asking for. So if I\'m displaying a page\nwith 10 entries on each page and want to show page #51, I just do the above.</p>\n\n<p>As far as I can tell Microsoft SQL Server has no equivalent syntax. You can do something similar to this\nwith a cursor, but as far as I can tell its complicated to do (at least I haven\'t seen any easy boilerplate\nthat I can use everywhere). Plus there are all these different kinds of cursors and its hard to understand the \nperformance trade-offs of each.</p>\n\n<p>Now to be fair, I don\'t know the real performance of the MySql implementation. Presumably when you say LIMIT 500,10\nthe database is calculating the first 510 lines of the result set and only returning 10. But the easy way with SQL\nserver involves returning all 510 lines and then throwing away the first 500, which can\'t be better. Plus in\ntheory given the knowledge you want that 51st page, MySql could be doing some cool optimizations to improve\nperformance.</p>\n\n<p>So- anyone with advice on the best way to do this with Microsoft SQL Server? <a href=\"mailto:alex@hopmann.org\">Write please</a>...

I\'ve been messing\nwith this for awhile but I\'ll admit that being <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/14.10/microsoft.html\">quoted \nmentioning it in an article in Wired Magazine</a> was extra motivation to actually\nget it online today.</p>\n\n<p>To the best of my knowledge, CalendarData.com is the first production site to support Live Clipboard. Doing some searches I haven\'t\nfound any other sites implementing it other than Ray Ozzie\'s example pages. I noticed a grip over on mini observing that little progress has\nbeen made since it was introduced back in April. This kind of whining is percisely why traditionally companies like\nMicrosoft hold these things back until they are all ready to go. The thought process goes \"until our entire product line is ready to support\nthis and we have 100 developers lined up with us with press releases, let\'s keep it under our hats\". That approach <i>IS</i> appropriate for\nsome things, but I\'m a big fan of \"get it out in the community and see where it goes from there\" instead.</p>\n\n<p>Today\'s implementation is just a start- I\'ve got lots of ideas about how to extend this further including adding some new clipboard\nwidgets to collect clippings, and some new formats to represent RSS feeds, calendars, and links to other objects (for example a link to a photo).\nAnother big issue we need to tackle is some UI evolution- to be honest, the little clipping icons scattered all over the page look somewhat\ncluttered once you have a user interface with multiple elements. It might make sense to hide them somewhat until you move the mouse over their\nassociated object, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Another observation from implementing this stuff- coding and debugging JavaScript in web pages pretty much sucks. Its much easier in Firefox\nthan IE since the Firefox JavaScript console, DOM Inspector and Web Developer toolbar are a great help. I assume there are similar things for IE\nbut I\'m not aware of them, so shoot me an email if you have suggestions. Still, as I\'m starting to use some JavaScript libraries for Live Clipboard\nand the Prototype AJAX library, I often find myself chasing small syntax errors for unnaturally long time-spans.</p>\n\n\n]]&gt;','Technology- CalendarData.com supports Live Clipboard',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-calendardatacom-supports-live-clipboard','','','2006-09-28 23:00:00','2006-09-29 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=32',0,'post','',0),(33,1,'2006-09-17 23:00:00','2006-09-18 04:00:00','I mostly try to avoid addressing political issues here and usually find conspiracy theories \nuninteresting outside of episodes of 24. \nHowever <a href=\'http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/10432334/was_the_2004_election_stolen\'>this article by Robert F.

I did not have a normal bike at the time and I was hoping I could get \nsomething that was the best of both worlds- a real mountain bike that could fold in half, easily\n fit in the car\'s trunk or an airplane and then go up a real trail. The <a href=\'http://www.dahon.com/us/zerog.htm\' title=\'The Dahon Zero-G Folding Mountain Bike\'>Dahon Zero-G</a> seemed to \nfit the bill so I got one.  I\'ve had it now for a year and a half but today is the first time I \ntook it out for anything beyond the roads and paved paths of Seattle.</p>\n\n<p>I should be clear that when it comes to real mountain biking I\'m a big wimp. I enjoy the easy \ntrails but I\'m not so excited about feeling like I\'m sliding down something out of control or near\n a precipice. Today we were up at Whistler and they have an inexpensive rate for the bunny hill. I\n took the bike up for a few runs and overall I can say it did a great job on those runs. One thing\n I did learn is that its really important to tighten everything before doing real off-road riding.\n On my last run a bolt fell out of my rear brake and it failed which was a bit exciting to put it mildly.</p>\n\n<p>Overall it\'s a pretty great bike and it wasn\'t its fault that I didn\'t check the screws in the \nbrakes.

The experiece of building toolbars for IE and Firefox is pretty\nradically different. <a href=\"http://www.borngeek.com/firefox/toolbar-tutorial/\">This tutorial over on Born Geek</a> was very helpful and I got some\ngood results in just a couple of days. Overall debugging was moderately easy since I could install the Firefox developer tools and use the JavaScript\nconsole. I did hit one intermittent crash that was almost a ship-stopper, and did I mention that the documentation for this stuff is terrible? I dont mean to complain- I know its all free, but if Open Source stuff wants to compete with the alternatives, they need to provide some great reference materials for developers. When trying to use XUL the behavior of the 6 different kinds of buttons and various layout things seemed pretty random, and it was pretty much trial and error getting it to work right.</p>\n\n<p>We werent even going to do an IE toolbar initially because I figured it would be a couple extra weeks of work to get all the COM and C++ stuff right. I went searching for some sample-code and came across <a href=\"http://besttoolbars.net/\">ToolbarStudio on http://besttoolbars.net/</a>. To \nbe honest my first reaction was that this was pretty damn weird. A full IDE for creating toolbars? With the ability to do all kinds of stuff with no coding (which was almost a negative for me)? For $75? Is there really that big a community of people out there making toolbars, and who really installs that many toolbars anyway?</p>\n\n<p>It turns out that ToolbarStudio is pretty cool if a bit clunky. The definition of the toolbar is all XML, HTML and JavaScript. The environment makes you edit everything packaged in a CAB file which is a bit strange for normal development process / builds / source control. We have also hit a few bugs but so far they have been very responsive at answering questions although the response time is always overnight since their developers are in Russia. The biggest problems are that debugging my JavaScript in this environment can be a nightmare. There isnt the same notion of a console to output debug messages (that I know of), exceptions tend to get silently dropped (things just dont work right), and the process of installing, testing and uninstalling the toolbar can be tedious (also true for the Firefox environment).</p>\n\n<p>One other note- so far Ive been unsuccessful at building a signed Firefox toolbar. Given how (one might say) arrogant the Firefox folks tend to be about their security being better than IE, this is pretty surprising to me. Most Firefox extensions that Ive seen arent signed and Firefox barely gives you better UI for being signed. To sign an extension you use some Netscape 4 era tools and need to do some bizarre packaging involving putting magic files into a ZIP in just the right order. To cap it off, if you dont get it right the package wont install, but the error messages wont really tell you what is wrong. Its a nightmare. Ive heard some rumors that this is getting better, but if the Firefox are really serious about security (as opposed to serious about pretending to have security) they will make signed extensions both a real advantage for developers, as well as easy for everyone to do.</p>\n\n<p>Of course its possible that Im just missing the key instructions- Google doesnt always find everything easily. If so Ill be happy to get pointers to the magic solution and post my apologies up here.</p>\n\n]]&gt;','Technology- Toolbars and Browser Security',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-toolbars-and-browser-security','','','2006-08-30 23:00:00','2006-08-31 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=37',0,'post','',0),(38,1,'2006-08-29 23:00:00','2006-08-30 04:00:00','Last night I updated CalendarData.com with a <a href=\"http://www.calendardata.com/developer/\" title=\"CalendarData.com developer information\">page of developer information</a>.

I suppose the first sad thing is that it took my awhile to\nbother trying to fix it. I tried disabling drivers, making sure my memory cards were secure. Yesterday I started running the Microsoft memory test\ntool and the Dell diagnostics and everything was coming up great. Part of the issue is that the kernel driver that it was reporting the crashes in turns\nout to not be the real source of the problem.</p>\n\n<p>After a few searches I tracked down the issue to a driver called tfsnifs.sys. It turns out that the Sonic DVD software that\nDell includes with the laptop somehow turned on its \"DLA\" feature which does some drive-letter mapping for I think writable\nCD and DVDs. I\'m not sure how this got turned on but I probably accidentally launched it trying to burn an ISO or something.</p>\n\n<p>In any case the software appears to be a piece of crap. I really wish Dell did a better job making sure the stuff they\nshipped on their PCs was higher quality. The sad truth is that they are more interested in selling you the upgrade to whatever\npackage is installed. Still, this explains the huge tech support problems they have been experiencing. Between poorly-written\nanti-virus, firewall, and three media center packages and all trying to fight for the system resources its amazing that it runs\nas well as it does.</p>\n\n<p>In any case, my experience is stay away from the Sonic stuff- it appears to suck, and I did check and there is no upgrade\navailable at the moment.

I do have two critiques. The first is that they were really poor at providing\n information on the players. Here we had two out-of-town teams playing. There was no program for sale (that I saw). Even a photocopied piece of\n paper listing the players names and #s would have been great.

The big\nannouncement this week is that Dell will shortly have an internal adapter for their laptops that uses the Broadcom chipset. This\nsuggests to me that if I\'m going to get a new router (and I\'m getting really unhappy with my Belkin Pre-N) I probably want\none of the the Broadcom ones.</p>\n\n<p>The other interesting new development is that Netgear finally introduced a router that has the high-end networking (N) and\ngigabit Ethernet ports. Since I use gigabit Ethernet at home its somewhat painful for me to be hooking in a 100mbit router since I\nhang a few devices off the router\'s wired ports. The tricky part is that Netgear has two versions of their 802-11N routers- one\nuse the Broadcom chipset and one uses the Marvell chipset. The bad news is the gigabit version is only available with the Marvell\nchipset and eWeek has reported that it has more compatibility issues talking to other devices than the other chipsets.</p>\n\n<p>All this is made much worse by my experience with the quality of router firmware. It tends to just be terrible, and the bleeding\nedge models are even worse- I\'ve seen horror stories of routers that show up and have such buggy firmware they barely work at all. It\nreally feels like some event will have to happen to shake up the home router market since in its current form it really isn\'t serving\ncustomers very well. It sure is nice that the prices are so low, but I\'d pay an extra $100 easily for a router that actually works 100%.</p>\n\n<p>Tip- you can tell what chipset the NetGear routers have by the last letter of the model name.

When I built a web-server back \nin 1996 when there was still a market for web-servers, our killer feature in Boulevard \nwas that it had a bunch of cool graphs so you could sit at the console like a vulture \nand watch the blips come in as users accessed your site.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"boulevard.gif\" alt=\"Watching a webserver circa 1996\" /></p>\n\n<p>Now that Im running several web-sites again I of course wanted to have something \nsimilar again. Partly it is related to my philosophy of build, get in front of real users, \nand iterate. Having a really tight connection to whats happening, what activity is popular, \nwhat gets lift is important. But I think it also goes beyond the practical into the psychology \nof building software live on the internet. I tweak the UI and watch for the difference my \nchanges may make. For example I made some changes last week and there was a pretty noticeable \ndifference in how many people found their way past the find feeds UI to an actual calendar \n\n<p>I\'ve built a little WinForms app that downloads updates from the server logs every 5 minutes, scans through the\ndata and does various custom analysis including popular pages (broken down to specific parts of the site), bot analysis,\nand whatever else strikes my fancy. Its really easy to update and add new stuff, especially since its pretty brute-force\non the actual data analysis side.</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"logdisplay.jpg\" alt=\"Watching a webserver circa 2006\" /></p>\n\n<p><b>Calendar Feed for the day-</b> <a href=\"http://www.calendardata.com/feed/51\" title=\"Computer Industry Conferences at CalendarData.com\">Computer Industry Conferences including\nthe upcoming Apple WWDC in two weeks</a>.

First we went to the bike store to get some good \nbike-lamps and I also got some gloves and some padded bike pants. We headed up \nthe pass and left my car at the end of the trail and took Kat\'s up to the \nbeginning.</p>\n\n<p>The Iron Horse trail used to be a railroad track through the pass and has \nbeen converted into a hiking and biking trail. Because it used to be for trains \nthe grade is pretty even the whole way through- its the easiest way to go \nthrough the mountains without lots of up and down. The direction we went is \noverall slightly downhill- enough to keep a nice pace while still being a nice \nworkout. The trail starts off with an almost 3 mile tunnel. The weather in the \narea has been close to 100F, but the tunnel was probably around 50 degrees, \ncooled by the melting snow run-off. One thing that surprised me a bit about the \ntunnel is that it was completely straight- you could see this little speck of \nlight at the other end over two miles away.</p>\n<p>Mostly the path was very nice for biking- dirt and some gravel. There were a \ncouple of bridge overpasses that were much thicker loose gravel and those were \nfairly treacherous. There are also several side-hikes available along the way \nthat are worth checking out sometime in the future.</p>\n\n]]&gt;','Hiking- Biking the Iron Horse trail',0,'','publish','open','open','','hiking-biking-the-iron-horse-trail','','','2006-07-22 23:00:00','2006-07-23 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=47',0,'post','',0),(48,1,'2006-07-20 23:00:00','2006-07-21 04:00:00','Today Eric and I did the hike to Rachel Lake.

First of all, I\'m not \nfollowing the old model of \"develop an app for a year (or 6 years) in secret \nuntil its all perfect and then launch it to an amazed public.\" With the new \nsite, everything is pretty much out in the open. I\'ve been building it for a \ncouple months without announcing it, but the site has actually been up and in \npublic for a bit. I\'ve also been rolling out changes to the site a few times a \nweek, sometimes more- so far today the site has already had two updates, first \nto enable wiki-like functionality where you can mark a calendar as \"open\" so \nanyone can add and edit events, and the second update to make some UI \nimprovements, get rid of unnecessary clutter, etc.</p>\n\n<p>As I do this, to be honest the site so far looks really bad. Its still too \ncluttered, the usability is poor, it needs lots of design help, and more. \nHowever there were several factors that prodded me towards putting it up even in \nsuch an unbaked form. First of all, lots of the functionality is already there, \nand I find it useful and hope some others might too. Second, it can take a long \ntime for the search engines to find you and index you and its probably a good \nidea to get that process going as quickly as possible. A spider isn\'t going to \ncare about the UI, so there is no reason to hold up getting that going. Finally \nI\'m already learning a lot from the visitors that arrive at the site. I could \nhave spent a few more months designing the perfect UI, and would have been \ntotally wrong about how real users would be interested in the site. Now, I need \nto be careful to not assume that the trickle of current visitors are \nrepresentative of the (I hope) future mass audience, but tuning a UI in the \npresence of real data is a dramatically different thing from doing it in the \nabstract.</p>\n<p>So that\'s how it goes for now- I\'ve turned on the wiki features, so in \naddition to importing a feed from some existing service you can create brand-new \ncalendars, and/or go add events to existing ones. In the next couple of days \nI\'ll add the ability to put descriptions and links into events, be notified when \nchanges happen to calendars you have edited, and display stats on how much you \nhave contributed to the community. The next goal is to get a set of people who \nhave actually come to the site and contributed in some way.

It was pretty amazing how\nmuch gear we packed in his airplane. The flight was beautiful; we landed and had a nice BBQ dinner.</p>\n\n<p>Today we got up very early (at least by my standards) and headed up to Logan Pass which is on the continental divide. From there\nwe hiked about 3-4 miles on the Highline Trail to \"haystack\" little peak that Michael had scoped out for climbing. This was my\nfirst time really climbing with ropes and all outside. I\'ve done it many times in the gym but outside is a very different thing. It looked\nlike the climb was going to be pretty easy though which is just how I like it.</p>\n\n<p>The first pitch was a breeze and was good confidence building. After that though the third pitch had a really tricky first bit. I was pretty\nwiped out when I got to the top. After everyone got to the top of that we were trying to figure out how far it was to the top- we could see\nwhat looked like an easy bit, but it wasn\'t clear if that was the top or whether there were going to be some other tricky spots. Part of the\nappeal of this climb was that the other side was a very gentle grassy slope. So we decided to see if we could traverse out to find an easier\nway up to the top.</p>\n\n<p>I suspect this wasn\'t a great idea. We roped for the traverses but they were still pretty difficult and slow and things weren\'t getting\nany better. Eventually we could see what looked like the grassy slope close ahead, but there were also two ravines in the way\nand those can be really difficult to cross.</p>\n\n<p>So we decided to down-climb. I found the belay-down much scarier that in the gym at first. At the gym you just get to the top of the\nwall and you already have your butt hanging over nothing. I finally managed to get going and we all got down but it took a while. We were\nall pretty tired and eager to get back to the car and our camp-site.</p>\n\n<p>For dinner we were really roughing it- since we were car-camping we had huge steaks, asparagus, baked potatoes, butter, a couple nice\nbottles of wine and to top of off chocolate fondue.

But if you can\'t \njust lay it out in a blog, what\'s the point? Today I set the Media Center PC to \nrecord the Germany vs. Italy game. I also set to record the next two programs \nsince the games often go over the \"allotted\" 120 minutes in the ESPN schedule, \nbut ESPN does keep showing the whole thing. Note- this is not a slam on ESPN at \nall- while I suppose you could complain about some of the commentary, overall \nthe World Cup coverage in the US has improved 10000% in the past few years and \nwatching not-interrupted by commercials games all the way through is great. When \nI went to watch it I discovered that the Media Center had screwed up and only \nrecorded 12 minutes of the main game. So I skipped forward to the next \"show\" \nand sure enough the game was 0-0 in overtime! Thank you Media Center for saving \nme from 90 minutes of crappy soccer.</p>\n<p>At which point I need to remind folks that this was a game with Germany \nplaying. Look, if you want to convince a typical American that their stereotypes \nabout soccer are wrong, show them any game with the Brazilian team. Even losing \n(rare) they do it with big smiles, stylish moves, and keep playing hard on the \nattack the whole time. If you want to convince that same American that their \nstereotypes are 100% right, show them a game with the Germans. Let\'s just say I \nwasn\'t shocked to see a 0-0 tie although a 1-0 victory with 75 minutes of \ndefensive boring play would have been more typical.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, the overtime was very cool, the Italians scored a beautiful goal with \n1 minute left and then followed it up with another beautiful goal catching most \nof the German team on the attack.

I\'m sure these are accurate as far as they go, yet they are still missing \nquite a bit of the details. Tim Bray wrote\n<a href=\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/21/RDFNet\">a good \nversion of the CDF -&gt; RDF side of things</a>, and\n<a href=\"http://www.codeproject.com/books/rss_samplechapter.asp\">this book by \nHeinz Wittenbrink</a> mentions the CDF angle a bit.</p>\n\n<p>The RSS Specifications web-site says that RSS evolved from RDF which was invented by Ramanathan Guha. However its important to point\nout a couple of additional specifications that came before RSS. Before he went to Netscape Guha was at Apple where he invented\n<a href=\"http://www.guha.com/mcf/mcf_spec.html\">MCF, the Meta Content Format</a> \n. MCF was based on a name:value format similar to MIME, and Internet email \n(<a href=\"http://www.imc.org/ietf-calendar/archive1/msg00385.html\">see the \nMIMEDIR specification</a>) but was only implemented\nin a strange experimental 3D browser called HotSauce that Apple shipped for a brief period of time.</p>\n\n<p>Beginning in 1994 I started developing some formats and protocols to use Internet standards for a rich client online application. One\nof these formats was called \"WindowScript\" and it was presented at an IETF meeting I think in late 1995. It used the name:value style\nto specify the user interface of an application, effectively the same concept as XUL (although much less sophisticated at the time). The\nnotion was that you could specify complex User Interface like a whole email application using WindowScript and it would data-bind to\nHTML and other content to interact with the user.</p>\n\n<p>When I joined Microsoft in November 1996, one of the early projects I got involved with was helping create a format for specifying\ndata about web-sites. The initial vehicle was supposed to be the feature \"channels\" in IE 4, but as is often typical at Microsoft\nwe had fairly grandios ideas about broader applications. At some point in early 1997 Thomas Reardon dragged me down the hallway\nto meet with Jean Paoli who had just joined Microsoft and was talking about this new thing called \"XML\". It seemed like XML was going\nto be big some day, so we quickly changed all the colons to angle brackets in the spec and published \n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-XMLsubmit\">\"Web Collections in XML\" to\nthe W3C on March 7th, 1997</a>. To the best of my knowledge this is the earliest existing document addressing XML- at the time I believe\nthe decision had not yet been made by the XML working group to make tags and attributes case sensitive and there are several other\nhistorical oddities in that spec.</p>\n\n<p>Dated 3 days later on March 10th, 1997 was Castedo Ellerman\'s <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-CDFsubmit\">Channel \nDescription Format (CDF) specification</a>. I don\'t remember why we diverged and published two similar but slightly different\nspecs on the same week- I was working with Castedo at the time. I suspect the issue was that IE was under huge pressure to ship\nquickly and they felt like they needed their own thing that they could just lock down and be done with right away.</p>\n<p>In the summer of 1997 Guha, now at Nescape responded to our Web Collections \nand CDF proposals by adapting\n<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-MCF-XML-970624/\">MCF to be expressed in XML</a>. The W3C saw these many different proposals and created a \nworking group to sort out the differences. The W3C was very interested in \npursuing this as part of their semantic web initiative. Inside Microsoft we had \nshifted our thinking a bit at this point and thought that these meta-data \nproposals were unnecessary since the XML was the way to represent the meta-data. \nOf course XML still needed schemas to do useful applications but we didn\'t see \nmuch value in RDF, being a language in between the base XML language and the \nactual application-specific schemas.\n<a href=\"http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2003/05/21/RDFNet\">Tim Bray\'s \npost</a> back in 2003 acknowledges \"it hasn\'t exactly turned the world inside \nout\" and RDF hasn\'t made much adoption progress since then. I\'d argue that the \nratio of \"data expressed in RDF in 2006\" vs. \"data expressed in any XML-based \nformat in 2006\" (a number pretty much indistinguishable from 0) suggests we were \nright. If RDF were really solving such a crucial problem I\'d bet that it would \nbe pretty widely used 8 years later. Tim argues that RDF\'s problem is that the \nformat is too obtuse, but again, if it were really solving a problem, a \nsimplified format such as he proposes would have happened by now. Instead \nformats like RSS and ATOM suplimented with all sorts of extra XML tags continue \nto take the Internet by storm. </p>\n\n<p>Neither MCF, RDF, or Web Collections anticipated the notion of blogs and a feed of posts. They were all more\nfocused around site-map type applications and more traditional notions of web site publishing. Dave Winer created RSS based on some\nof these earlier formats for this application and the killer makes all the \ndifference (in a good way!) I do remember in the spring of 1997 talking with Dave Winer and evangelizing CDF to him.\n If I recall, his reaction was that he didn\'t really get the \"channel\" thing \n(which is not a surprise since it was mostly just a Netscape vs. Microsoft hype \nthing around the latest buzzword- \"push\") and that the CDF format seemed too complicated. I recall\nbuilding a CDF \"Channel\" for scripting news, but the whole channel notion fizzled so much over the summer of 1997 that the CDF\napproach was quickly forgotten.</p>\n\n<p>For comparison sake, here are some examples of what the various formats look \nlike.

Sometimes these could be pretty \nfrustrating, but I realized over time that one of Bill\'s great gifts was the \nability to look at things over a 5+ year timeframe. The catch is that the words \ndidn\'t always come out that way so it was easy to get upset when Bill was \ncritiquing some part of your strategy or product. By adding a \"within 5-7 years\" \nat the end of statements things often became less confusing and distracting.</p>\n\n<p>My favorite quote, \nand I\'m never going to forget this one was \"I can\'t believe that anyone with any \nf**king IQ is thinking about this problem\".

I called Verizon and they \nconfirmed that I was eligible for the discount. I asked the woman if she could \ncheck whether any of the local stores had them in stock. She said she couldn\'t \ncheck by computer but offered to call all the stores for me and call me back \nwith the results. I\'ve often used this forum to complain about bad service (like \nAmerican Airlines) but Verizon won big points this week for one of the best \ncustomer service experiences I\'ve witnessed in some time.</p>\n<p>As for the phone I first need to include the disclaimer that I\'ve had the \nphone for less than 24 hours. My typical experience with new high-tech gadgets \nis that the first week is great and its only a few weeks later that the \ndownsides of the device start to be very painful. Having said that so far I\'m \nvery impressed with this phone and the first 24 hours are way better than the \nfirst 24 hours with my old Samsung i630. (Anyone want a free Samsung i630? Just \nemail.)</p>\n<p>The good stuff- My favorite positive surprise is actually the power charger. \nIt uses the mini-USB connection to charge the phone. So if you plug it into your \nlaptop, it charges (or at least holds the battery level), and there is only one \nconnector for docking, power charging, and its a totally standard connector. \nI\'ve got dozens of different shaped power adapters from old phones and other \ndevices and switching to a standard shaped connector (and a multi-function one \ntoo!) for the power charger is a major consumer friendly innovation. Thank you \nMotorola!</p>\n<p>The phone looks and feels good and the call quality is much better than what \nI was dealing with before. Its a bit of a pain to hold the phone when talking on \nit so I\'m investigating ear-bud/headset options. The big issue for me is whether \nto go bluetooth for the headset or not. Wireless seems nice but the extra weight \nand pain of dealing with batteries in the headset seem less nice.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.junefabrics.com/pdanet/index.php\">Using PDANet is great</a>. \nI\'ll need to try it out a bit more but being able to have roaming Internet on my \nlaptop anywhere without needing a wifi connection is great. The only issue so \nfar is that I got a bluescreen once while using it, apparently in the USB \ndrivers. Probably Dell\'s fault, but still annoying.</p>\n<p>The scroll-wheel is very good but not perfect. I like it a lot better than \nthe touch-screen for reading Internet sites and getting through email. Trying to \ndeal with scroll bars by tapping them on my friends Treo\'s (both the PalmOS and \nWindows versions) really sucks and the wheel is much better. Still the \nergonomics of the wheel could be better- it feels a bit cheap and I can\'t help \nbut think Apple or Sony would have figured out the physical design somehow so \nthat it would be much easier to scroll quickly and precisely.</p>\n<p>Between the EVDO high-speed network, the scrolll-wheel and the reasonable \nscreen, using this phone for Internet browsing is a huge improvement. I checked \nout Google Local and Bloglines and both were very well suited to this form \nfactor. It doesn\'t seem unreasonable to use this device to keep up on blog-reading \nwhen away from a desk.</p>\n<p>Finally the price is just awesome. With a contract and corporate discounts \nthe phone can be purchased for as little as $150 which is less than half what \nthe competition costs (the Treo 700 will cost you $300-$400 depending).</p>\n<p>The so-so- Overall the phone is faster than my old phone, but not as responsive as a \nnon-smartphone. It takes forever to startup from a power-off. </p>\n<p>The bad- I\'m really concerned about scratching the screen. I\'ve had \nflip-style phones before and when they are closed it protects the screen. I \nreally need to find some sort of screen-guard but there is nothing off the shelf \nyet. Also the key-guard doesn\'t appear to have the option to auto-activate on \nidle (I suspect this feature exists but I can\'t find it yet). Its also very sad \nthat the feature of using blue-tooth to let your laptop connect to the Internet \nis disabled, presumably because the carriers want to sell some extra expensive \nservice on top of their already expensive internet service for the phone.</p>\n<p>Overall so far I think the phone is great. It has just about all the features \nyou would expect and with the price point its at Motorola is well positioned to \nmake a big sweep of the smartphone-with-mini-keyboard market for the near \nfuture.</p>\n]]&gt;','Technology- Motorola Q Phone, the Honeymoon Review',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-motorola-q-phone-the-honeymoon-review','','','2006-06-06 23:00:00','2006-06-07 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=65',0,'post','',2),(66,1,'2006-06-05 23:00:00','2006-06-06 04:00:00','With the weather turning nice I\'ve started regular BBQ parties again. I was hoping to do my slow-smoked dry-rub\nribs yesterday but we were travelling over the weekend and I didn\'t have the necessary stuff in time (the ribs).</p>\n\n<p>So instead I grilled some lamb with my special marinade. Note that its really \nimportant to understand the difference between BBQ and grilling. Barbeque is \nslow cooking with smoke and indirect heat while grilling is cooking relatively \nquickly over direct heat. For the marinade my \"secret\" ingredient is roasted \ndried fenugreek leaves from <a href=\"http://www.vijsrangoli.ca/market/index.html\">Vij\'s Rangoli</a> (the market next to Vij\'s) in \nVancouver. I mix them with salt, fresh chopped rosemary from the garden and a \nfew other herbs (winter savory, some crushed pepper and some thyme) and some \nolive oil. Marinade for 4 or 5 hours, heat up the grill. Throw the lamb on the \ngrill on one side, sear it, then turn it over and reduce the heat. Note that the \ngrill will flare up quite a bit from the olive oil but that\'s usually ok since \nyou want to sear the outside anyway. You just don\'t need to blast the heat \nsuper-high.</p>\n<p>I think they turned out pretty great. Hillel mentioned that they were salty \nand I did overdo the salt a bit, but the interesting thing is that he mentioned \nthat he had thought the salt was just from the lamb. Proper seasoning (using \nsalt) is really important to cooking and its one of those things I often get \nwrong, but it was pretty cool when it works out such that it integrates well \nwith the dish.</p>\n<p>Today I plan on shopping fpr materials for my spice rub for some proper ribs \nfor next week. I also want to try a pork shoulder sometime soon but I need to \nmake sure I have the heat on the smoker fixed for that.</p>\n\n\n]]&gt;','Cooking- Grilling/BBQ',0,'','publish','open','open','','cooking-grillingbbq','','','2006-06-05 23:00:00','2006-06-06 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=66',0,'post','',0),(67,1,'2006-05-31 23:00:00','2006-06-01 04:00:00','A new hobby for me is whitewater rafting. Kat was a commercial rafting guide \nso we have a bunch of friends who hit the local rivers during the right time of \nthe year. Last year was a bit of a bust because the snow levels were so low- \nrafting in the north-west mostly relies on the melting snow to bring up the \nwater levels. This year is the opposite- we had huge snow all winter and the \nrivers are just huge right now.</p>\n<p>For her birthday I got Kat a new raft- anTer\n<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/B00099YDTQ/lancairtalk-20\">Aire Super Puma</a>. \nThese are a bit smaller than a normal commercial raft but more importantly they \nare more streamlined at the ends- this means they are both more maneuverable but \nalso easier to tip and take a bit more work to keep pointed in the right \ndirection.</p>\n<p>We spent a whole evening putting the raft together- you need to lace the \nfloor in which is a super-pain.

We had seen them at the \nParamount and it was really disappointing. Pretty much nothing but bed-wetter \nsongs and very pop-music-for-15-year-old-girls sort of thing. Luck for me at \nSasquatch they turned it all around and played an amazing rocking set.</p>\n<p>\nThey were followed by Beck \"presented in puppet-vision\". Beck had a little \npuppet stage set up in back and the big screens showed the (live) footage of the \npuppets acting out all the musicians on stage. He also had a guy who did just \ncrazy Napoleon Dynamite style dancing and played a ton of my favorites.</p>\n<p>\nIn the end Sunday pulled it all out for Sasquatch but in retrospect I should \nhave only gotten tickets for Sunday. Still Sunday was a great show and I\'m \nreally glad I didn\'t miss it.</p>\n\n]]&gt;','Music- Sasquatch Festival',0,'','publish','open','open','','music-sasquatch-festival','','','2006-05-29 23:00:00','2006-05-30 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=69',0,'post','',0),(70,1,'2006-05-25 23:00:00','2006-05-26 04:00:00','This weekend Kat and I are off to the Sasquatch Festival which has expanded into a three day\nevent held at the Gorge in eastern Washington.

We had been planning on flying down\nto Napa but the Napa forecast was for thunderstorms which put a damper on the whole thing\n(since they are aren\'t especially good for flying OR for nice wine-tasting parties).</p>\n<p>Last year we had a similar change of plans and just went to Portland for the weekend instead. This\nyear we headed the other direction and headed up to Vancouver.</p>\n<p>One note- I\'d love to be pasting some of these reviews on <a href=\"http://www.judysbook.com/\">Judy\'s Book</a> but \nthey don\'t appear to cover anything in Canada. I\'ll have to chat with folks back in the office about that this week,\nalthough I do understand that there is probably a pretty high entry cost into any new geography for them.</p>\n\n<p>Friday night after a long drive we went straight to <a href=\"http://www.vijs.ca/index_in.htm\">Vij\'s</a>. We were a little stressed that we wouldn\'t make it \nin time before they closed but everything worked out. We checked in and had a nice glass of wine and some snacks\nas usual while waiting. I just don\'t understand why more restaurants can\'t do half as good of a job of taking care\nof their guests that are waiting for a table. The meal was wonderful as usual- we had short ribs with cinnamon, an Indian crepe with navy beans, venison \nmedallions, \nand their signature lamb popsicles with fenugreek cream sauce. I also managed to pick up an extra canister of their\nroasted fenugreek leaves which they normally sell in the shop next door. At this time of night the next-door place was\nclosed but the proprietor got me a can anyway. This has been my secret ingredient recently in a lamb marinade I make for the grill so\nI was pretty eager to get some more.</p>\n<p>Saturday morning we \nwent to the <a href=\"http://www.granvilleisland.com/\">Granville island public market</a> for lunch and a little shopping. Maybe some \nVancouver residents think the opposite but this feels much cooler to me than the \nSeattle public market. Lot\'s of interesting food stalls, not quite as much \nstraight tourist junk and several shops offering stuff that is really hard to \nget in the US including some leaves used for Thai curries, etc. We had a good \ndonut but the secret was to get an absolutely fresh one- the other ones we tried \nwere just ok. We also had a bagel from Siegels- these were only ok again but we \nfound out later that their main branch is in town. We also sampled a soup from \n\"The Stock Exchange\" and some pies from \"A La Mode\". The soup was pretty good \nbut I found the pies disappointing- especially the raspberry/rhubarb which just \ndidn\'t taste right for some reason.</p>\n<p>After lunch we headed to the movie theatre to see the Da Vinci Code. I \nthought it was pretty good- when I read the book I felt it was written to be a \nbetter movie than novel in the first place and the movie didn\'t disappoint \n(although neither did it join the pantheon of the greatest movies).</p>\n\n<p>For dinner Saturday we went to <a href=\"http://www.lumiere.ca/\">Lumiere</a> where we sat at the \"tasting bar\" \nwhich is actually a set of tables outside the main dining room (although they do \nhave a few seats at the actual bar that are open for walk-up guests). I thought \nLumiere was great- we started with a hamachi salad which included some crab and \ngreens. We then had some squash ravioli with truffle butter sauce. I\'ve often \nfound squash ravioli to be a fairly boring dish put on the menu so there is \nsomething for the vegetarians, but these were great- intense and flavorful. The \nthird starter we had was the duck broth with dumplings. This was a stand-out for \nthe whole evening- worth the trip just for this one dish. The duck broth was \njust so flavorful. For our main courses we had veal cheeks, foie gras two ways \nand some potato puree and two-color asparagus. These were all very good, \nalthough it was another example of dishes that were bigger than they needed too \nbe and that were also outclassed by the appetizers. The appetizers were just \nmore interesting and memorable. We finished with a tapioca pudding and a \nchocolate fondant and a glass of Gehning Brothers 2003 Riesling ice-wine which \nwas really excellent. Some of the ice-wines are over sweet without the right \nbalance but this one had a great acid and tropical fruit flavors.</p>\n<img src=\"Squash Dumplings Lumiere.jpg\">\n\n<p>Its also worth noting that the wait-staff was great. Good wait-staff can\'t \nmake up for bad food but at an already good place makes it extra special. They \nwere attentive, helped us deal with our small table and made some great \nrecommendations for the next day. This is where we heard about the main branch \nfor Siegel\'s bagels and Caffe Artigiano. The next morning we started off \nchecking out Artigiano where they made a great \"Spanish Latte\" which included a \nlittle sweetened condensed milk, some great coffee and clearly skilled \nbarista\'s. After that we headed to the main Siegel\'s branch which was I thought \nbetter than the bagels in the market. And finally as we headed out of town we \nstopped for our real lunch at Sun Sui Wah which is probably the most well known \ndim sum place in the Vancouver area.</p>\n<img src=\"caffeartigiano small.jpg\">\n\n<p>We stayed at the <a href=\"http://www.listel-vancouver.com/\">hotel Listel</a>. The Listel is somewhat less expensive than my \nfavorite place The Opus, and its in a pretty good location and I thought the \nservice was very good. Their \"thing\" is that they feature lots of art including \nart from a local gallery in most of the rooms on the floor we were staying on. \nThis made it better than your typical generic business hotel, but it still \nwasn\'t as stylish or cool as I expected. There was one big problem with it \nthough- the shower was not very nice to start with and the water temperature \nsucked. It was just way too cold. To be fair, we didn\'t complain about this \nuntil on our way out so we didn\'t give them enough chance to fix the problem. \n</p>\n<p>The trip back across the border was a pain as usual. I really need to check \nout the <a href=\"http://getnexus.com\">Nexus pass</a> thing since that line just \nzooms by the rest of us. There was this annoying guy ahead of us in line who \nkept shutting his car off every time he stopped and then had to restart it again \nto move forward. Cars from the other lane kept scooting in front of him and \nevery time (dozens!) he started his car we could smell the stick behind him. I \nhave to assume he thought he was somehow saving fuel or reducing polution \nwithout realizing that starting a conventional engine (as opposed to a hybrid) \ncauses a ton more pollution than just leaving it running for a couple of \nminutes. \n</p>\n<p>One other quick note- many of my friends and I have done lots of food photography over the\nyears (check out <a href=\"http://www.tastingmenu.com\">tastingmenu.com</a> for some of the best). \nGetting good photos in the low light conditions of a restaurant is always a big problem. But if you\nuse the flash the result is often washed out and even worse. Lately I just figured out a track of using\nthe flash but putting a napkin over it- the resulting lower level of diffuse light works just great and\nwhile you need to be a little careful to not annoy other diners too much it isn\'t as bad as the full flash.</p>\n]]&gt;','Travel- Vancouver',0,'','publish','open','open','','travel-vancouver','','','2006-05-20 23:00:00','2006-05-21 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=72',0,'post','',0),(73,1,'2006-05-19 23:00:00','2006-05-20 04:00:00','I\'m interested in exploring creating RSS feeds with calendar data.

Their\nsite is a cool place to share tips about great local shops, restauarants, ask questions to the local\ncommunity and all that kind of thing. It\'s got all the usual modern cool things \nlike friend lists and a trust system that helps the community rate who provides \nhelpful advice and keep out the trolls.</p>\n\n<p>So far I couldn\'t be more happy with the experience. Ok, its only been two \ndays (+ a little extra) but it has really been one of those experiences where it \nfeels like I\'m understanding much better what I\'m really good at (and enjoy the \nmost) at work. Plus its always great to meet a bunch of smart enthusiastic \npeople working on an interesting project.</p>\n\n<p>At Judy\'s I\'m working with a small team of people to come up with some \ntotally brand new stuff. Of course I can\'t say anything about what it is yet, \nbut the whole combination is really cool. Part of what I\'m enjoying is that with \nthis small team I can be really fast at \npulling together prototypes, concept pages, etc. We can do a \ncombination of conceptual discussions (who are the customers?, how do we compare \nto the competition?) with concrete \"wouldn\'t it be cool if it worked like this\", \n\"let\'s try it this way\" development. </p>\n\n<p>I feel like its important for me to acknowledge at this point that I \nrecognize that the \"deliver the product over successive years\" part of the job \nin the software industry is really important. I\'m even slightly defensive on \nthis topic since I get concerned that people think I\'m not good at finishing a \nlonger project. In reality I\'ve shipped dozens of versions of the Resnova \nproducts, stuck through a 3 year Exchange 2000 product cycle and spent more than \n3 years working on Avalon.</p>\n\n<p>What I\'ve realized is that I can do those projects. I spent years thinking that was what I had to do to be on \ntrack for a successful career. More recently I\'ve been thinking that since my skill-set seems especially well suited for that first \n6-12 months of a project, I should focus on how to deliver the most \nvalue with that. Right now I\'m actually doing that with three \nprojects simultaneously and while that is probably a bit much, it still helps \nevery day feel different and gives me plenty of outlets for creativity.</p>\n\n<p>\nWorking on projects like these can have some unique challenges. For example, you \nwant to build things so that as much as possible of what you build can be \ncarried forward, especially the architecture. The last thing anyone wants is to \ninherit a piece of junk that is held together (barely!) with bailing wire and \nneeds to get scrapped in a big, expensive, from-the-ground-up rewrite. At the \nsame time, realistically anything you create in the early phases is going to get \nrewritten over the next 6-24 months. Hopefully several times. So build things \nwith an elegant architecture, but with rapid development techniques and plan on \neverything getting rewritten one chunk at a time as the needs change.\n</p>\n\n<p>The \nother set of issues and revolve around your team. I\'ve often noticed lots of \nuncertainty in dealing with other people. Is it a prototype? Is it production \ncode? How much does it represent a statement about the future product direction? \nThe simple answer is that in a startup, <i>everything</i> is an experiment, but that level of ambiguity can be a really \ndifficult thing. I\'ve met many people who thought startups would be great for \nthem but they wound up miserable with the level of change and uncertainty. I\'m \nprobably confusing some people who have worked with me since I\'ve been in a role \nwhere I\'ve been trying to lock down a plan and reduce churn before. To deliver \npolished products to customers you do need to lock down at some point. Part of \nthe fun thing about this current role is that those type\'s of issues aren\'t \nsomething that I need to deal with.</p>\n\n]]&gt;','Jobs- Contracting for Judy\'s Book',0,'','publish','open','open','','jobs-contracting-for-judys-book','','','2006-05-17 23:00:00','2006-05-18 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=74',0,'post','',0),(75,1,'2006-05-12 23:00:00','2006-05-13 04:00:00','<a href=\"http://news.com.com/Why+the+world+doesnt+need+high-def+DVDs/2100-1041_3-6071610.html?tag=nefd.lede\">David Pogue wrote a good article in the NY Times today on why the world \ndoesn\'t really need high-definition DVDs</a>. He goes into why this is a cynical \nattempt by the consumer electronics and movie industries to get you into another \nround of buying all new equipment and re-buying all those movies that you \nalready bought once on VHS and again on DVD.</p>\n<p>The one thing that the article doesn\'t go into is how these guys are missing \nthe thing that I think consumers actually <i>DO</i> care about. I agree with his \nreview that the new movies do look somewhat better than existing DVD on a great \nlarge screen (I got a chance to check this stuff out at the CES 2006 \nconference). However I would trade that in a minute for a truly convenient movie \nwatching experience. I personally hate dealing with the masses of physical DVDs \n(or music CDs for that matter) and rip everything onto a server. In doing so I\'m \ngiving up some quality, but the overall experience is way better and the number \nof difference devices that I need to get it all to work is greatly reduced.</p>\n<p>So where is the industry then when it comes to providing the really \nconvenient integrated experience without lots of physical media? One could \npresume that the issue is that this is a disruptive technology (see the book \n\"The Innovator\'s Dilemma\"). The existing industry is used to making money by \ncoming up with a new generation of hardware and using that to resell both the \nplayer and all the content again. To them they don\'t see any upside in providing \nconsumers what they really want.</p>\n<p>The problem with creating the disruption is that the 5 main studio\'s control \nall the content and as far as I can tell they don\'t want this model to change at \nall either. So you can\'t just bypass the consumer electronics industry right now \nand provide the true \"buy a movie, have it on your local server, watch from any \nmedia device in your house anytime\" experience with the existing movie studios. \nHowever another lesson from The Innovator\'s Dilemma is that the disruption \nusually starts outside of the existing structure. The best example I\'d point to \nright now is <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/\">youtube.com</a> which is \nincreasingly providing some really interesting content that you can just watch \non any computer in the house. This last week for example I was able to watch two \nreally good pilots for TV shows that never got picked up and another interesting \nshort movie. All of my TVs are attached to computers so that connection already \nworks for me, but it doesn\'t for most people, and youtube also needs to be \nhooked up so its easier to add \"content\" from youtube into my own library. It \nwould also be nice to be able to get somewhat higher quality content- DVD \nquality can be done for about 600MB/hour and I often don\'t mind setting \nsomething to download and watching it later.</p>\n<p>A lot of attention has been paid to the XBox 360 with a HD-DVD player and the \nPS3 with Blue-ray. For me these are both very important devices but their \nability to play high quality video off a server of via the Media Center Extender \nsupport is much more important to me.</p>\n<p>Of course I\'m usually wrong about what consumers really like. I hate \nring-tones and can\'t believe that the industry makes billions (really) selling \nstupid little song loops for $3-4 each (especially given that the songs \nthemselves sell for $1). Maybe consumers will flock to the stores buying Hidef \nequipment and content, but I\'m hoping the disruption grows somewhere and that \nthe studios realize pretty quickly they need to jump on board.</p>\n<p>]]&gt;','Technology- High-Def DVDs',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-high-def-dvds','','','2006-05-12 23:00:00','2006-05-13 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=75',0,'post','',0),(76,1,'2006-05-08 23:00:00','2006-05-09 04:00:00','\n<p>I\'m spending the beginning of this week touring around Oregon\'s Willamette \nvalley, specifically Yamhill country near McMinnville and Newberg. This area \nspecializes in Pinot Noir which is a grape that I\'ve continued to have a hard \ntime \"getting\". I\'ve had some very good Burgundy wines but whenever I find one \nthat I like they always wind up costing more than $300/bottle. In any case I \nthought it would be a great idea to check out the region in a bit more depth to \nsee if I can appreciate the wines a bit more plus I have heard that the area is \nbeautiful and not over-developed and over-crowded like Napa.</p>\n<p>We flew in to the McMinnville airport and our first stop was across the \nstreet at the Evergreen Aviation Museum, home of the \"Spruce Goose\", Howard \nHughes\'s famous airplane. The thing is just incredibly huge- basically bigger \nthan a 747 or 777, yet almost entirely made out of wood. The museum also has a \ngreat collection of other airplanes including a Beech Constellation (first \nproduction composite aircraft, a Burt Rutan design), a Titan II rocket, and \nplenty of other stuff to put it into the world-class catagory along with the \nBoeing Air Museum in Seattle and the Air &amp; Space Smithsonian Museum in \nWashington D.C.</p>\n<p>From there it was pretty easy to hit a few wineries. There are tons of them \nall around and they are pretty close together, but we did discover one issue \nwith visiting the area. Most of the area\'s wineries and restaurants are closed \non Mondays and many on Tuesdays. For future trips I\'d recommend going Wednesday \nto Friday for easier availability of visits.</p>\n<p>We stopped by Archery Summit where we tasted several wines. This was a pretty \ngood way to get started since I was familiar with them from their past \nassociation with Pine Ridge in Napa (although that association appears to be no \nmore- the woman in the tasting room seemed slightly offended when I mentioned \nPine Ridge.) The setting was very nice, and the wines were pretty good, although \ntheir most expensive one didn\'t really impress me that much and the price tag \nfor the one I like best was pretty high. One interesting angle was the hard-sell \non their wine club. Basically they made a big point that their wine club is \nalmost full and at that point they aren\'t going to bother selling any wine at \nretail since the club will buy up the whole allocation.</p>\n<p>From there we cruised around, found lots of places that were not open on \nMonday and ended up at the Ponzi wine bar in downtown Dundee. This was a nice \nplace to sit down, have a snack and taste some wines from Ponzi and some of \ntheir friends. We checked in to the hotel, rested a bit and had some nice \nSpanish food at Las Ramblas on the main street of McMinnville.</p>\n<p>On Tuesday we got up and made some calls for some appointments at some other \nwineries. We started out at Sineann which was a great experience. The place is \ntiny, sharing space with Medici and Russell Hodgkins, the assistant winemaker \nstarted off pouring us tastes of 11 of their released wines, including three \nGewrztraminers, a bunch of Pinot Noirs and a Merlot and a Cabernet Sauvignon. \nOf the Pinot Noirs, I actually enjoyed their basic \"Oregon\" best- it had a rich \nfull nose with vanilla, tobacco, and a little touch of root-beer. The mouth-feel \nwas medium, but with really great balanced fruit. They make a bunch of single \nvineyard Pinot Noirs, but to me, none were better than the blended one.</p>\n<p>After tasting the release wines Russell took us to barrel taste. We probably \nhad another dozen or more tastes and these were a fascinating chance to compare \nthe different vineyards and even different blocks within the same vineyards. \nOften it was amazing how distinct it could be even within the same vineyard. \nBarrel tasting is difficult since I still have a very hard time translating to \nwhat the finished wine will be, but opportunities like this are the sort of \nthing that you need to experience to build that skill so I really appreciated \nit.</p>\n<p>As we barrel tasted Russel mentioned that they make some Zinfandels. We had \nbeen joking earlier about the concept of Oregon Zin, but I really enjoyed the \ntwo they were making so I picked up a few bottles of the earlier vintage in \naddition to some of that Oregon Pinot.</p>\n<p>After Sineann we headed to the nearby Domaine Serene which appears to be one \nof the more established estates. The buildings were gorgeous with way more space \nthan they needed for their production level, and some really cool architectural \nelements like a triangle/spiral staircase that went up for 5 or 6 stories. Their \nwines were nice, but again for me they were overpriced compared to how much I \nloved them. My favorite was their 2003 Winery Hill Pinot Noir which was \napparently only planted in 1999. This was the first vintage, but while it had a \nlighter nose (the bottle had just been opened) it had more finish and complexity \nthat some of the others.</p>\n<p>For dinner we went to Joel  Palmer, which is a place that we discovered \nspecializes in wild mushrooms. I\'m not a big mushroom person (I usually avoid \nthem) but the food here was very good and I managed to both find some things \nthat were not mushroom-heavy and enjoy the mushrooms in the amuse bouche and the \ntastes of my friend\'s food. We had a GREAT bottle of wine with dinner- The 2003 \nPatricia Green Bonshaw Pinot Noir. This was just great, bold and yet with plenty \nof complexity and elegance. It went great with the mushroom stuff, but also with \nthe spiciness of the crab bisque I had and showed a super-long finish. Patricia \nGreen is a definite stop next time I\'m in the OR wine country.</p>\n<p>My overall conclusion is that there are plenty of great Pinot Noirs coming \nout of Oregon that I can really appreciate. You have to do some work to find the \ngreat ones that are a good value, but that is true for almost any grape/region, \nand the ratio in this area of worthwhile stuff seems much higher than in \nBurgundy. I\'m looking forward to checking it out again and seeing if I can turn \naround my general prejudice against Pinot Noir.</p>\n\n]]&gt;','Wine- Touring Yamhill Valley, OR',0,'','publish','open','open','','wine-touring-yamhill-valley-or','','','2006-05-08 23:00:00','2006-05-09 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=76',0,'post','',0),(77,1,'2006-05-05 23:00:00','2006-05-06 04:00:00','Coming soon- those Coachella pictures and a write-up on my new laptop, the Dell Inspiron E1505.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime I\'ve been busy this last few days writing a bunch of code, Back in 1996-1999 I wrote a bunch\nof code in Java but have not written much since then since for most purposes C# has been more convenient (and more\nrecently PHP). However this week I wanted to build an iSCSI server (or \"target\" \nto use the iSCSI terminology) that was very portable and Java seemed to be the \nright fit. I\'m happy to report that it didn\'t take more than a few hours to get \nback into the swing of it. Even better, Java development has progressed quite a \nbit compared to when I last remembered it. The Eclipse IDE is really quite nice \nand makes it pretty fast to get going, although it still has quite a few rough \nspots compared to the Microsoft Visual Studio environment.</p>\n<p>iSCSI is an interesting beast. No comments right now on why I was doing this, \nbut it is a TCP based protocol that lets you connect to a disk drive over any IP \nconnection. <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=12cb3c1a-15d6-4585-b385-befd1319f825&amp;DisplayLang=en\">Microsoft has an iSCSI \"initiator\" for Windows</a>\n (again, iSCSI terminology \nfor client) that lets you mount an iSCSI volume and have it show up as if it \nwere just a locally attached drive. It\'s a bit complicated to use, but the nice \nthing is that the iSCSI protocol has relatively simple semantics and once its \nworking you have a fully functional remote drive. Basically there is a bunch of \nconnection setup and configuration stuff, and then its just \"read block\" and \n\"write block\" that that\'s it.</p>\n<p>So far my implementation is a bit rough but I\'m surprised by how quickly it \ngot to the point where it works with most applications and has fairly good \nperformance. I was easily able to max out the bandwidth of my wireless network \nwith minimal CPU usage on the host and got most applications working including \nExplorer, Visual Studio, etc (but not SQL Server). </p>\n\n\n]]&gt;','Technology- iSCSI',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-iscsi','','','2006-05-05 23:00:00','2006-05-06 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=77',0,'post','',0),(78,1,'2006-05-01 23:00:00','2006-05-02 04:00:00','As usual I let the pressure of catching up on the posts about the Spain trip get in my way from posting about other stuff. Without further delay I\'m going to instead write about this year\'s Coachella festival.\r\n\r\nThe Coachella festival is one of the big things I look forward to each yet. For me this rates way above other normal holidays like Christmas and all that junk. We rented a nice house in Palm Springs with a pool and invited a bunch of friends and my brother, sister-in-law and nephew out to join us for a long weekend. Thursday evening we flew down. It should have been a great flight but I initially flew up to 23,000 feet and Kat got altitude sickness which was no fun (and a special bummer since it was her birthday). After that we descended to 19,000 and the flight was great except for the last little stretch where we hit some storms down in southern California. In any case being able to fly non-stop all the way to Palm Springs sure is great, I just wish the airplane was pressurized.\r\n\r\nFriday was awesome- just hanging out by the pool, sipping margaritas, and a bit of tennis. In fact the only thing we did wrong with our planning is not saying through Monday to do the same thing again to recover from the shows.\r\n\r\nOverall this year\'s festival was great, but not quite as good as last year. They have usually done an amazing job of logistics given the 80,000 people that attend, and once again the traffic was actually really handled well, and while the lines to get in were a bit long overall it wasn\'t so bad. The one thing they really screwed up was the Madonna show.  Part of what makes the 80,000 people thing work is that a quarter or more of them just get parked in front of the main stage and they stay there to get their great spots for the main headliners. This year on Sunday they had Madonna play the dance tent instead of the main stage (and more on her act later) and this created a massive traffic jam as 40,000 people\r\nleft the main stage to go to the dance tent and then back after she was done.\r\n\r\nThe music highlights for me this year were (in descending order)- Bloc Party, Daft Punk, Art Brut, Franz Ferdinand, Ladytron, Lady Sovereign. Carl Cox and stellastarr* also seemed really cool but I barely caught them so I\'ll reserve judgment for later.\r\n\r\nSaturday we got in just in time to catch Lady Sovereign. She was pretty good- basically a somewhat less interesting version of MIA. After she was done we headed over to the dance tent to catch Joey Beltram. He was very good during his actual tracks but his transitions were pretty unsmooth frequently breaking the groove. We wandered around a bit and saw a little bit of Wolfmother who seemed to think they were Led Zepplin, which didn\'t really do anything for me. Clap Your Hands Say Yeah were decent, but TV On the Radio were very disappointing.\r\n\r\nFinally we got to see Ladytron- they started off a bit slow (low energy) but it built up during the show and the last few songs were awesome. When they finished we headed over to the main stage where Franz Ferdinand had just started. We watched them from way back, but there was actually room to dance and I was bouncing all over the place with some guy that I think was from Scotland. They put on a great set which was amazing for the main stage at a huge festival and I can\'t wait to see them in a club again sometime soon.\r\n\r\nAt this point we headed over to the dance tent to get a spot for Daft Punk. Audio Bullys were on and they were pretty disappointing so we saw Depeche Mode do 3 songs that were also very lame. Nick and I scoped out a pretty good spot mid-way back but in the tent for Daft Punk. The thing that sucked was that for 15 minutes before the show and 20 minutes into the show we felt like we were in the middle of a highway with people pushing by us. What was most funny to me was when people would get offended that I wouldn\'t step out of the way as they pushed me out of the way- my take is, sure, push to the front if you want, but don\'t expect me to be friendly about it and keep going if you are going to do it.\r\n\r\nThe sound started with the alien tones from Close Encounters, the curtains opened and Daft Punk were in this pyramid dressed in alien space-suits (I\'ll post some pictures tomorrow). They had 3 layers of cool lights on the side and the pyramid itself had cool displays. The beats were awesome and it was just an amazing show. You can check out some at <a href=\"http://www.daftpunk.com/\">http://www.daftpunk.com/</a> althoughunfortunately the video is in the Real format.\r\n\r\nSunday we got to a bit of a slower start and missed Mates of State, but got there just as Ted Leo / Pharmacists were starting. Ted Leo was pretty good although nothing super amazing. After Ted Leo we saw Matisyahu from the beer garden by the main stage- again, he was decent but especially for the festival thing wasn\'t that great. We went right over to get a good spot for Bloc Party.\r\n\r\nTo say I\'ve been anticipating seeing Bloc Party would be an understatement. Last year when I saw them I had no idea who they were and even at Sasquatch I knew a few of their songs a little bit. Since then I\'ve listened to Silent Alarm hundreds of times and I consider it the best album from last year. About the second song of the set I bounced into the middle of the crowd where a bunch of people were bouncing all over. The set was just incredible. The crowd was totally into it in a way you rarely see at festivals, the band was really on for almost the whole set, and I had such a great time I almost passed out. I\'ve seen some music press mention Adorable when writing about Bloc Party and the comparison is apt- they both have a great combination of high energy and slower songs, huge passion and just a great stage presence.\r\n\r\nAfter the Bloc Party set I mostly wanted to collapse for a few hours but instead caught a few minutes of Paul Oakenfold and a beer. The dance tent was pretty crowded for Oakenfold (and also people lining up for Madonna) but his music didn\'t really do anything for me.\r\n\r\nBad logistics aside, the Madonna set was a disappointment. She went on 20 minutes late, the sound was really crappy from back where we started out. Also she played guitar on two of the songs which was a bit weird. I should be clear- its totally cool that she wants to reinvent herself a bit, but it was extra strange that she played the dance tent given the set she played. Finally she only played 5 or 6 songs and none of them hits (other than the single from the latest album). Now, you don\'t need to just play the hits, but a festival is not the time to drag out all the stuff from the new album- its just not the classic format for playing a festival and its too bad that she didn\'t tune her set for the venue. Finally, walking away from the\r\narea I could tell that a bunch of Madonna fans who came out to see her were really pissed off about the length of her set. They probably shouldn\'t have expected a normal concert-length set, but she went WAY shorter than the 50 minutes listed in the schedule.\r\n\r\nAfter Madonna Kat and I were stuck in the massive crowd movement and didn\'t make it to catch the end of Mogwai. We went to the outdoor stage instead of the main-stage which luckly wasn\'t too crowded and Kat promptly fell asleep. The Go! Team was ok although nothing substantial- Nick said he hated them. Finally we headed over to see Art Brut. Dungeon was finishing their set and they were just awful. I had downloaded 3 of their songs and they didn\'t seem so bad but they were just terrible. They also wouldn\'t stop and kept going for long after their set was supposed to be done. This meant that Art Brut was late to setup and they were having some problem with the bass amps so they started very late.\r\n\r\nFinally <a>Art Brut</a> went on. They hopped on stage and struck a bunch of rock and roll poses and after a little intro kicked into \"formed a band\". The singer, Eddie Argos , continued to insist that every member of the audience was required to go home and join a band. I love that kind of attitude. They strutted all over the stage, had great intros for their songs and Eddie at one point jumped into the audience and even tossed his microphone back just strolling through the audience encouraging everyone to shout the lyrics.\r\n\r\nAt one point Eddie announces that they have been given permission to go past midnight at a cost of $2000 per minute. Apparently the local noise ordinance charges that much if the shows go late. I suspect that Tool was on track to go 15 minutes late so Art Brut wasn\'t actually costing them anything but they played up the two... thousand... dollars... per minute.. and announced that they would use their extra valuable time to play a b-side, and then threw out the set list and did an appropriate choice of \"Moving to LA\" for the venue. Of course at this point its past 12:10 and they haven\'t done their last two songs \"bad weekend\" and \"good weekend\" so they launch into those, but are still taking their time while the guy at the side of the stage (roadie? manager?) is getting a bit tense. At the end of Good Weekend Eddie goes off stage but the band keeps playing. Its well past 12:20 right now and the stage guy is just getting frantic. He is motioning to the drummer to stop. But the crowd is going nuts and the band just keeps pumping people up. The stage guy runs out and grabs the drummer by the leg to try to stop him but continues to get ignored- he looks pyscho pissed and stressed out. Like he expects that at this point the band is being charged that $2000/minute. He motions to the sound board guys to shut them off but the drummer keeps going for at least another 30 seconds before finally leaving the stage.\r\n\r\nAll in all an awesome show. I just hope they didn\'t just get bankrupted by some fines or something. I am happy to see they got some good coverage in the LA Times review of the show and I really hope they make it back to the US. They feel like one of those things that are pretty uniquely British with tons of just incredibly obscure UK music references, but hopefully there are enough of us around here who get it when you title a song \"These Animal Menswe@r\" to keep them afloat.\r\n\r\nComing soon- tons of festival pictures and maybe even a little video.\r\n','Music- Coachella 2006',0,'','publish','open','open','','music-coachella-2006','','','2007-03-22 10:08:50','2007-03-22 17:08:50','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=78',0,'post','',1),(79,1,'2006-04-06 23:00:00','2006-04-07 04:00:00','\nFriday was the big day to tour the Alhambra. The Alhambra is the old \nvillage/palace/fort complex constructed on the hill above Grenada and various \nparts of it date back 1200 years and span many different cultures from the \nRomans, Arab/Moorish, Catholic kings to a modern day monastery. I\'ve done a lot \nof travel around the world and this is both one of the coolest things to tour as \nwell as one of the longest single sites (if you want to check out the whole \nthing).</p>\n<p>In the days prior to our departure the weather forecast for Southern Spain \ndidn\'t look good but luckily the weather forecasters were wrong and it was \nabsolutely beautiful. We hiked all over and I took an amazing amount of \npictures- over 1000 in this one day. The Alhambra has so many examples of cool \narchitecture so I took lots of close ups of various carvings or various designs, \nplus there are a ton of great spots for panoramic photographs. It will probably \ntake me weeks of playing around at home to pull together some higher quality \npanoramic stitches.\n</p>\n<img src=\"Alhambra Panoramic April 7th 2006 (1) Medium Web view.jpg\">\n<p>After touring all day we found a dinner place on a local square a bit away \nfrom the central tourist masses and returned for a second time to get some \ngelato at the Cafe Bib-Rambla.</p>\n<p>Another twist on the timing of our trip is that it was Holy Week (or Semana \nSanta). Many of the towns in Spain have traditions where they take their statues \nof the Virgin Mary out of their churches and parade them around while often \ndressed in clothes that resemble the Klu Klux Klan to American eyes (although \nthe Spanish traditions are much older and I gather the Spanish are annoyed that \nthe infamous American organization stole their symbol). These statues are on \nthese giant platforms and are often carried by 20-40 men marching along an inch \nat a time.</p>\n<p>We were tired after dinner and tried to pick up a taxi to take us up the \nhill. The driver refused to take us and at first I was pissed, thinking he just \ndidn\'t want to take the fairly short ride which would probably require him to \ntake a fairly long return with no fare (the streets out of the Alhambra are not \nstraight-forward to put it mildly). The driver managed to communicate to Stacy \nthat the way was blocked and sure enough we looked over and saw a police car \nblocking the road up to our hotel. We set off on foot but were unsuccessful \nasking the cop where and when the procession might be. We kept looking around \nand just as we were getting close to the top we started seeing some lights and \nnoises. My reaction was \"hurry up, let\'s go before we miss it\" but Stacy \naccurately pointed out that the thing\'s don\'t move very fast at all and there \nwas no rush.</p>\n<p>The procession at the Alhambra was a pretty small one I gather and they \nweren\'t even wearing the special clothing. Still it was pretty cool and it \nwasn\'t over until past 1am and they had delivered the statue back into the \nchurch right next to our hotel.</p>\n]]&gt;','Travel- Touring the Alhambra',0,'','publish','open','open','','travel-touring-the-alhambra','','','2006-04-06 23:00:00','2006-04-07 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=79',0,'post','',0),(80,1,'2006-04-05 23:00:00','2006-04-06 04:00:00','\nAfter a long day of travel we arrived in Grenada, got our bags and our rental \ncar. Picking up the car was really easy and while I was a bit concerned that the \n\"service needed\" message came on right away, it was driving fine and the only \nstaff-person at the Avis counter was gone by the time we were ready to leave the \nparking lot.</p>\n<p>We followed the highway signs for the Alhambra. Our hotel is actually on the \ngrounds of the site so we needed to drive up a road that is normally restricted. \nStacy proved her value right away by negotiating with the guard who restricts \naccess up to this road since we didn\'t have whatever documentation he expected \nto prove we had reservations.</p>\n<p>The Hotel America was great. Initially I wanted to stay at the main hotel on \nthe Alhambra site- the Parador. However the Parador costs about twice as much so \nwe had switched to the Hotel America which wasn\'t anything fancy, but it had a \nnice relaxed cafe and wasn\'t as stuffy feeling as the Parador.</p>\n<img src=\"Animation Granada April 7th 002 Medium Web view.gif\">\n<p>After relaxing a bit we joined Lauren, Ken, Olivia, Belle, Norm and Dan (big \ncrowd!) for a very nice dinner at a Moroccan place in the Arab quarter (I wish I \nremembered the name of the place).</p>\n]]&gt;','Travel- Arrival in Grenada',0,'','publish','open','open','','travel-arrival-in-grenada','','','2006-04-05 23:00:00','2006-04-06 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=80',0,'post','',0),(81,1,'2006-04-04 23:00:00','2006-04-05 04:00:00','\nOver the next couple of days I\'m going to post several entries with old dates on them.

Flying business class was a big bonus for \nthe layovers since we got to stay in the special lounges. The other effect of \nthe reschedule was that they said they couldn\'t book us seats ahead of time. We \nbrought Stacy to help with Fen and Olivia (two 7-8 year olds) but the bookings \nwere different so when we checked in they couldn\'t get Stacy seats with the \nkids.</p>\n<p>Luckily we managed to negotiate seats together on each step but I noticed \nthat the Spanish airports aren\'t set up at all to make seat changes at the gate. \nThe folks at the gate don\'t have a way to do anything other than take the \ntickets and put people on the airplane.</p>]]&gt;','Technology- Blogs and Travel',0,'','publish','open','open','','technology-blogs-and-travel','','','2006-04-04 23:00:00','2006-04-05 04:00:00','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?p=81',0,'post','',0),(82,1,'2006-03-29 00:00:00','2006-03-29 05:00:00','\nToday I moved www.alexhopmann.com over to the hosting provider.

I got my Apache logging working using cronolog to create a new log \nevery day. It took a bit since it was distributed source-only and I couldn\'t get it to compile at \nfirst. It has a \"configure\" command that you run that tests the environment and creates appropriate\n makefiles. First step was realizing that I didn\'t have gcc, but that was easy since the configure \ncommand gave me a good error message to that effect.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nBut once GCC was installed it was still giving an error message that it wasn\'t actually working.\n I tried running the compiler and it gave up an error message that the linker was actually failing\n to load glibc.o. A little research suggested this was the standard c library and a bit more research \nsuggested that it needed to be installed on its own. The package name wasn\'t obvious- I think it was\n libc6-dev. At this point everything compiled and it was only a few more steps to get the files \ninstalled in the right place and update the apache configuration files to use the log rotation tool.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nOf course there were no direct examples of the right syntax to use to configure Apache to use the\n cronolog. And when I started Apache and it just didn\'t have any error messages, it took a bit to\n figure out how to tell what was wrong. I figured out how to shut down Apache in the \"service settings\" and \nrun it from the command line where I could read all the error messages and debug my configuration files. A\n little while later and its running fine and I just finished up fixing some differences in the stuff I \nbuilt between IE6 and Firefox. The key one is that IE6 exposes any extra attributes you sprinkle in your \nHTML directly in the object model and in Firefox you need to call .getAttribute() and .setAttribute() to \nread and write them.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThis linux stuff does feel like its just held together with duct-tape and bailing wire sometimes. I\'m sure its mostly\nthat I\'m not familiar with it, but finding things can be tough when they can be in /usr/bin, /var/bin, /usr/sbin, /usr/local/bin,\n/usr/local/sbin, or who knows what other directories. On the one hand the way that individual pieces are really building blocks\nfor each other can be really powerful, but if you have some obscure configuration problem in one place on your system its really\neasy for the whole thing to stop working correctly. I\'m sure Windows has many similar situations.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe other thing I noticed today was that I really need to get this moved onto a hosting provider\n if I\'m going to put more sophisticated stuff up here.

A little \nresearch revealed it was someone looking at photo libraries on this site.

Like I mentioned before this <a href=\"http://www.ubuntu.com/\">Ubuntu Linux</a> has come miles from what I remember in\n terms of the ease of setup. A couple of days ago I installed <a href=\"http://dev.mysql.com\">MySQL 5.0</a> on my Windows server which\nwas pretty much 100% automatic. Install and it ran a nice little wizard to help with initial setup and it was all running.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n\n This morning I went into the Synaptic Package Manager on the linux machine to install \nit. All went pretty easily and I got it installed in just a \nfew minutes which was mostly download time.\n</p>\n\n<p>\nThe first snag happens when I go to try to set up some accounts for my\n apps to authenticate to the server. The Linux box isn\'t accepting the \ncommands that worked on the Windows one. After a bit of messing around I notice\n that the Linux machine has MySQL 4 installed which is pretty radically different \nthan version 5.

I guess \"Linux x86 generic RPM\" and \ndownload those just to discover that I don\'t have the RPM utility.

For the post title\nI borrowed a phrase from the Colbert Report that sums up nicely how angry I am with the experience. This was the worst travel I have ever experienced and that is a catagory with lots of competition.</p>\n\n<p>We started off with a nice morning / early afternoon in Baltimore and headed out driving to Washington National with what we thought was plenty of time. We got a bit messed up in the directions and made it to the airport with no time to spare- luckily Kat was able to do a web check-in on her phone and we ran through the terminal, picked up the paper tickets at the desk and ran to our gate just as they were calling final boarding.</p>\n\n<p>Unfortunately we are delayed on the ground about 5 minutes because ATC has some radar outage. In theory this shouldnt be a big deal, but I check the tickets and apparently they only gave us 35 minutes to make our connections at Dallas (to be clear these were booked directly with American Airlines). DFW is a huge airport and American has gates spread out over 4 terminals there now. We arrive in Dallas, but then get held up another 10 minutes because another airplane is still at our arrival gate. A bunch of the passengers start to get tense since we all have tight connections and its especially frustrating looking out the window at all the adjacent gates that are empty. Why dont they just park us at the next one? Eventually they move the airplane in, and again Im surprised that they flight attendants arent making any special effort to help people with tight connections- no announcement about waiting to get off if you dont have a close one or anything.</p>\n\n<p>Our connecting flight is across the airport- we landed in C and needed to get to D. There is this skylink train thing but it loops around the outside and would have been 20 minutes easily. There is a ramp across the road between the terminals so I decide to run for it and Kat and Fen will follow as quickly as they can. On my way out I ask a guy at the counter to call over to the other gate and tell them they have 3 passengers on the way. I dash down the terminal, up the escalator, across the ramp, down the escalator, and arrive at the destination gate, looking at my watch- 2 minutes before the scheduled time. Right as I get there the gate attendant announces to me that the flight as left and closes the door in my face and heads down the ramp.</p>\n\n<p>Ill have to admit that at this point I got quite irate and was yelling. I had just been running for 10 minutes straight and it tends to ramp up the adrenalin + the frustration levels. My anger was increased by the gate attendants non-communicativeness. I pictured them shutting the door on an airplane with 3 empty seats just because they wouldnt hold up the airplane for an extra 2 minutes (to be clear- the door of the airplane wasnt closed yet, the guy was going off to go do that).</p>\n\n<p>At this point the remaining woman at the desk (or the guy who closed the door in my face) could have probably defused the situation by saying quite simply \"we put some last minute people on the airplane so your seats are full and its not like we can go on the airplane and drag them off. There is another flight to Seattle tonight and we will make sure you get on it.\" I know dealing with upset travelers is probably the worst part about those jobs, but its still part of the job and doing it right with honest clear communication is important. Instead they took the approach of \"maybe if I ignore you then you will go away\" which when one is in a complex travel situation just makes you more upset.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually the supervisor came out from the gate and he did seem to understand the basics of the above. He explained that American Airlines was basically having so many delayed flights that they were just assuming that tons of people would miss every connection. They were aggressively giving away seats for people who hadnt shown up 10 minutes before the fight since they always had a huge crowd of people to push to the next one.</p>\n\n<p>The next problem though was that he chose to exact a bit of revenge on me for being upset at the gate. He got Kat and Fen on the next flight but only put me on \"standby, which gives you an excellent chance to get on\". Calmer now we went to the next gate and waited. I figured that since I had gold status with American Airlines that was supposed to put me at the front of the standby list, so no problem.</p>\n\n<p>Two hours later the next flight boarded, they called some standby passengers and Im still waiting. Its 10 minutes before the fight and the gate attendants are looking over the folks that are going to get screwed on this connection- look, there are 3 coming from Costa Rica, no way they are going to make it on time. They are giving away their seats, and at the last minute (10 minutes before the time on all the screens and all the tickets) one person does make it. They tell me Im out of luck and they will get me on the morning flight.</p>\n\n<p>At this point Im pretty much in shell-shock. Three minutes later a woman runs up and goes through the same thing I did at the previous gate. She starts out screaming \"I cant believe this, it says Ive still got time, Im going to be fucking fired if Im not in Seattle for work tomorrow morning\". She manages to stop screaming but her voice is still not normal. The three people from the Costa Rica flight show up and are pretty annoyed but are still on vacation-mellow. They are all really confused about how this happened to them and the woman behind the counter isnt giving an honest explanation so I tell them what the guy at the other gate told me. Now she is pissed at me and accuses me of trying to start a riot (and to be clear at this point Im very calm and just matter of fact explaining what I just witnessed happen to them). Again its the \"maybe if the passengers just don\'t know the system they will go along like sheep\" attitude. Luckly we now have things like blogs to get the word out.</p>\n\n<p>So she sticks me with a middle seat on the morning flight and wont help me with a hotel room and says I need to talk to the supervisor. He takes about 15 minutes to finish up helping someone with some unrelated flight and then looks at my info. At this point he comes out and says that they intentionally screwed me on getting on this evenings flight because I had been upset at the other gate, hooks me up with a voucher for the Clarion inn, and sends me off.</p>\n\n<p>The shuttle to the hotel takes about an hour to pick me up. Its actually really cold in Dallas- about 40 degrees. When the shuttle does come Im the first to get on but at the next terminal there is such a big line for the Clarion shuttle (all of whom had been waiting over an hour) that they all cant get on and we have to turn away others. I speak with the shuttle drive who says that its just been crazy for the past two weeks- something changed two weeks ago and American is bumping way more people all the time.</p>\n\n<p>The morning flight was pretty normal and uneventful other than again overcrowded shuttles- I wound up sharing a taxi with some others rather than waiting another 20 minutes. They had no problem switching my center seat to an aisle.</p>\n\n<p>To sum it up, there were a whole host of things that are totally wrong here. First of all, American Airlines has pushed their hub thing beyond its limits- trying to schedule 35 minute connections (which a flight attended for another airline described as an illegal connection), and by policy showing inflexibility in helping people make those connections is just a really bad way to run things. But I suspect the problem is deeper since this approach gives them plenty of people who are bumped by accident- which lets the airline overbook and avoid having to ask for volunteers that can cost them $200-$400/seat to get. Intentionally causing your passengers to mess up their itineraries in order to deal with your overbooking situation is just an evil way to treat people.</p>\n\n<p>Then, given that situation, the way your staff deals with people is just not ok. Ive heard a few things about the unhealthy airlines lately and I wonder how much of what I saw was a symptom of the dysfunctional labor/management thing going on at American. The non-communicative attitude and the staffs need to show customers whos boss by screwing my getting on the next flight is not going to get the airline healthy again. At this point I cant imagine any destination that I need to get to so badly that I would make another connection at DFW and in general Im all set to avoid American whenever possible (although sadly that is not 100% possible).</p>\n\n<p>Finally, the situation with the official departure times is just wacky and I don\'t think this is unique to American Airlines.

I\'ve been getting a ton of crap for my beautiful\n  10-year old \"classic\" straight skis with a full 203cm length to handle carving the toughest ice. Ok, I suppose they are getting\n  a bit old, so I decided to demo for a couple of days to try to find some new ones.</p>\n  \n  <p>I suppose my first concern was that I wouldn\'t really be able to tell the difference between the various sets of skis. Who really\n  knows what kind of difference a bit stiffer or a slightly different curvature makes? To my surprise the different skis were \n	dramatically\n  different and some of the skis that were supposed to be best for my skiing \n	style were my least favorite. Some sets of skis just made me distinctly unhappy when I tried to \n	push them. They would try to decide the direction to go themselves or they \n	had big vibration problems. Some others were nice, but unexceptional. Two \n	sets- the Atomic Metron B5 and Rossignol Zenith Z9\'s both created a distinct \n	\"happy grin\" effect. The Rossignol\'s were $300 cheaper so I bought a pair \n	of those last night and skied on them all day today.

I still \n	really enjoy reading mini, although as many people have observed his \n	comments section has really gone to hell. My other observation is that while \n	I agree with a ton of the stuff that he writes, in many ways I think his \n	central premise- that the key thing to fix Microsoft is to just reduce its \n	size a bunch, is just incredibly unrealistic. There are two key issues here- \n	1) Just who does the scaling back anyway? The problem is that once you have \n	an organization with entrenched power structures, fiefdoms, etc. as you \n	scale back those tend to get maintained or even enhanced. Unless the senior \n	management types are super-human, the fiefdoms protect themselves and the \n	cuts probably in exactly the wrong places. 2) Microsoft has lots of \n	legacy. Sometimes you can try to ignore it, but the reality is that just \n	about every computer user in the world today relies on Microsoft\'s products \n	and they can\'t just quit maintaining them. And this means that every time \n	they fix something they need to fix it across ~33 languages across 6+ \n	different OS revs, etc. They can\'t afford to just abandon their existing \n	customers and architectures and the reality is that much of their bulk is \n	because of situations like that. If people blindly took mini\'s advice you \n	would likely have another situation like the run up to the great \"security \n	push\" and temporary abandonment of IE where people (myself included) got too \n	focused on the new great innovative stuff and ignored supporting the \n	existing stuff.</p>\n<p>On another topic I really really need to upgrade this site- I\'m going to make it my top \nproject to crank out some RSS feeds, etc. I\'m still going to stubbornly stick to \nusing my own custom tools to build the site.

Despite the title, the book doesn\'t really \nseem to be directly about marketing much, but there are a few really interesting \ninsights. One was that Microsoft was constantly re-orging in a way that people \nwere constantly working on new things. Some of the strongest things Microsoft \never did were the result of mixing up a bunch of people who weren\'t entrenched \nin the history of a specific area. At least back when I left in March it was \npretty common to have many of the main players in each area have been in the \nsame role for 10+ years. The guys running Office had been doing it forever. Many \nof the people running keys parts of Windows had been doing it forever. Microsoft \nstill does tons of re-orgs, but they rarely involve much substantial change that \nI\'ve seen.

One that is probably worth  sharing is the history of XMLHTTP.\r\n\r\nXMLHTTP has lately become a huge hit. It seems like people noticed it when  Google started using it in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en\">Google Suggest feature</a> and  they looked at the source code of that page to figure out how it worked. Google  had actually been using it earlier in GMail, but the JavaScript sources behind  GMail was much more complicated and people didn\'t notice it right away.\r\n\r\nSince then XMLHTTP and the \"AJAX\" (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) methodology have been mentioned in the Wall Street Journal and  <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/%3Ca%20href=\">CNET</a>  among other news sources.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that the client architecture of GMail appears to follow the rough  design of the Exchange 2000 implementation of Outlook Web Access for IE5 and  later which shipped way back in 2000.\r\n\r\nXMLHTTP actually began its life out of the Exchange 2000 team. I had      joined Microsoft in November 1996 and moved to Redmond in the spring of 1997      working initially on some Internet Standards stuff as related to the future of      Outlook. I was specifically doing some work on meta-data for web sites including      an early proposal called \"Web Collections\". During this time period Thomas Reardon       one day dragged me down the hall to introduce me to this guy named Jean Paoli that had      just joined the company. Jean was working on this new thing called XML that some people      suspected would be very big some day (for some unclear reason at the time).\r\n\r\nAfter I got the gist of XML, I switched my Web Collections proposal to take advantage of it      and published a \"W3C Submission\" entitled      <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-XMLsubmit\">\"Web Collections using XML\"</a>. In retrospect      this is actually a fairly embarrassing document, but what can I say- back at the time \"push\"      was the hottest thing on the web and to the best of my knowledge this is the earliest published      public document discussing XML anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis led to me getting involved with some Microsoft folks who were working on the WebDAV       standard and I made a big push to move WebDAV to using XML as its model for communicating       data. Shortly after I joined the Exchange team which was just ramping up on Exchange 2000       to lead the development of Microsoft\'s WebDAV servers (which were implemented both on       normal IIS over the file system- DAVFS, and over Exchange data- DAVEX).\r\n\r\nI don\'t recall exactly when we started working on Outlook Web Access in  	Exchange 2000. I think it was about a year after I joined the team, probably  	sometime in mid 1998. In any case we were already a milestone or two into  	the Exchange 2000 (or \"Platinum\") project and had been carefully ignoring  	the issue of OWA mostly because the old version was such a hack. The old  	version had been written in a big rush by a pervious iteration of the team  	using ASP pages and was both fairly ugly and had huge server scalability and  	performance problems.\r\n\r\nAt some point Brian Valentine (who was still the GM of Exchange at the time)  asked us to figure out what to do with OWA for Exchange 2000. There were two  implementations that got started, one based on serving up straight web pages as  efficiently as possible with straight HTML, and another one that started playing  with the cool user interface you could build with DHTML. When I first got a demo  of the DHTML work that Jim Van Eaton and Bob Gering were doing I was just blown away.  However they were basically doing hacky form-posts back to the server and had  some of the same scalability and dynamic data problems of the old version.\r\n\r\nThat weekend (I think shortly before September 10th, 1998 which is the earliest date on the spec) I startup up Visual Studio and whipped up the first version of  what would become XMLHTTP. The first version didn\'t have async support hooked up  and was pretty crude, but it was enough to help Jim and Bob talk to some of the  WebDAV/XML support we had already built for Exchange 2000 and make some really  rapid progress with their DHTML OWA implementation.\r\n\r\n<h3>How we actually shipped XMLHTTP</h3>\r\n\r\nIt was one thing to have this cool component we could use to talk to the server, but we still weren\'t in any position to use it in the shipping  	product yet. The basic premise of Outlook Web Access was that you could walk  	up to any computer that had the browser on it and just get to your email. If  	we needed to download ActiveX controls, it was going to ruin the basic  	premise of the product, so the next step was to embark on shipping this  	thing in Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nStep one was to bring the code up to production quality so we got Shawn  Bracewell, one of the devs on the OWA team to take it over. Being a smart guy he  promptly threw away all of my code and rewrote it in a more solid fashion,  adding async support, error handling and more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the IE project was just weeks away from beta 2 which was their last  beta before the release. This was the good-old-days when critical features were  crammed in just days before a release, but this was still cutting it close. I  realized that the MSXML library shipped with IE and I had some good contacts  over in the XML team who would probably help out- I got in touch with Jean Paoli  who was running that team at the time and we pretty quickly struck a deal to  ship the thing as part of the MSXML library. Which is the real explanation of  where the name XMLHTTP comes from- the thing is mostly about HTTP and doesn\'t  have any specific tie to XML other than that was the easiest excuse for shipping  it so I needed to cram XML into the name (plus- XML was the hot technology at  the time and it seemed like some good marketing for the component).\r\n\r\nWhile Shawn worked with Chris Lovett on the XML team to integrate with their  library, I covered the rest of the \"ship it\" bases and got sign-off from Joe  Peterson who was running IE at the time. We did a quick security review but at  the time no one really understood the seriousness or types of vulnerabilities  that anything shipping could cause. In terms of quality for the beta the theory  was \"no one other than OWA is going to try to call it so if it has a bug in the  beta, worst case we just can\'t use it.\" With a week to go before the beta we  checked it in, got a build and tried it out and everything looked great.\r\n\r\nThe beta shipped and the OWA team was able to start running forward using the  beta IE5, while Shawn fixed a number of bugs through the ship day of IE5. It  took us another year and a half to ship Exchange 2000, but this was one of those  cases where the little bit of planning ahead meant that by the time we shipped  the necessary bits were already pretty widely out there.\r\n\r\nActually shipping the thing required help from many more people that I\'ve mentioned      so far (and I\'m sure I\'ve forgotton others). Karim Battish and Sean Lyndersay were both involved at various times      keep the spec updated (which was written pretty much after the implementation, but sometimes      that is just how it works out) and working with partner teams. Chris Tyner was critical      on the test side- I\'m pretty sure without his energy and perseverance we would have      shipped the thing with numerous holes.\r\n\r\nIf I recall Chris made this killer HTML page that gave you a UI for sending arbitrary      HTTP requests. I think it was called \"DAVUI\" and it had templates for all      the common HTTP 1.1, WebDAV and special Exchange requests, and unlike the tool we had      been using before (that was a traditional Win32 EXE) you could just copy this one .htm      file to any machine or else run it remotely and it just worked. Brilliant.\r\n\r\nThere is a <a href=\"http://news.com.com/Web+tools+blaze+trail+to+the+past/2100-1032_3-5621010.html?tag=nefd.lede\"> 	new article on CNET</a> talking about AJAX / the Dynamic HTML + JavaScript + XMLHTTP      development methodology. It questions whether the AJAX approach diminishes the value of things      like Flash and Microsoft\'s Avalon / XAML. Having spent the past 4 years working on Avalon I      think this totally misses the value of Avalon and managed code. Building Outlook Web Access      was really really very very hard, and even so the results were not comparable to the real thing      (Outlook). You can\'t take it offline, you can\'t use it with multiple mail accounts in a coordinated      way, and the UI is just somewhat more clunky. This doesn\'t take away from the core value of OWA in      being something you can get to from anywhere. Still, the programming model and maintainability of the DHTML      approach was really difficult as the app got bigger. The beauty of many of the Google applications      is that they are really tight focused apps that don\'t try to do that much, but really take      nice advantages of the web characteristics. It seems like a false assumption to assume that this      approach will scale up for applications like Office. Avalon is based on a programming model      that is a big step up in terms of componentization and maintainability, plus it leapfrogs the      type of graphics, user interface and just plain experience you can deliver even with finely      tuned full Windows code.\r\n\r\nThe lesson to take out of this thing is to appreciate the importance of shipping and having the patience      to let something succeed. It feels like the press (and sometimes even the internal attitude)      about something like Avalon is to measure it by how many apps have adopted it on the launch day. That is      just crazy and it doesn\'t get the basics of how big a shift these sorts of things can be and how      long it takes to move the mind-set, learning, and deployment of a big new platform. I\'m convinced that      if Microsoft ships Avalon next year and Microsoft and the industry manage to stick to it and take the      long-term perspective, its going to be ubiquitous in 5 years. But it really does take a few years      before the actual momentum is there.\r\n\r\nThat was a great thing about working at Microsoft and I hope they still have it- the long term vision and ability to commit to things until version 3 when it really hits the mainstream. As a start-up we need to be constantly adapting, shipping very quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nI\'ve also got a few teasers online of new projects that I\'m working on. The image libraries   like <a title=\"airplane picture library with ajax zooming\" href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/view.php?p=airplanes\">this airplane picture set with AJAX based zooming and manipulation</a>  and <a title=\"CalendarData.com Calendar syndication, RSS feeds and subscriptions\" href=\"http://www.calendardata.com/\">my calendardata.com web site which helps syndicate calendar events</a> are some  to get started.\r\n<h3>Update- January 31, 2007</h3>\r\nAdam Bosworth gave a talk this week that was picked up in some of the press including <a href=\"http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2088644,00.asp\">this write-up at eWeek</a> and again at <a href=\"http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/30/2217255\">Slashdot</a>. He talks about the early days of DHTML and Ajax and some of the Slashdot comments have picked up on his talking about having invented Ajax and suggested this conflicts with my <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm\">Story of XMLHTTP</a> write up that has been carried in many online outlets lately.\r\n\r\nI\'ll weigh in and say that both are true. To the extent that there is some confusion its because what  we call AJAX today is a collection of many things- The basic dynamic  HTML infrastructure. The XMLHTTP & async network communication piece. And the patterns of tying it all  together.\r\n\r\nAdam and his team (especially folks like Rod  Chavez, Christian Fortini, <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=186137\">Michael Wallent</a> and many others, as usual I\'m probably forgetting to mention some of the key people) invented  the Dynamic HTML part which was miles beyond what Netscape was doing at the time. I just filled in the  XMLHTTP piece, and collaborated with many others to do the first major app that tied it together (Outlook  Web Access). Without the earlier contributions of the Trident/IE teams, it wouldn\'t have been possible, and  its absolutely true that Adam and many folks he worked with had the conceptual vision for tying it together  (he called it weblications at the time).\r\n\r\nHaving said that, they never built a real app with it and the act  of using it for real turned up some missing pieces, leading to XMLHTTP as well as several other things that  the Trident and XML teams themselves pioneered. I\'d also like to acknowledge the Adaptive Path guys for coming up with a nice description of the approach and giving it a word that wraps it up nicely (Ajax). At Microsoft we totally blew the opportunity to evangelize and get out in front of this approach back in 1999. That itself is a longer story for sometime in the future. I realize that some in the technical community are \"all about the engineering\" but effective marketing and communication of your ideas is important and we missed out on that.\r\n\r\nI do also think that Adam\'s discussion of why Ajax didn\'t take off in 1997 misses a key point. Sure, network connections were too slow at the time. The computers themselves and Javascript was too slow (recall that typical machines were 200mhz). The earliest versions of DHTML in IE4 had some.. er.. issues to work out (there was more than one reason that OWA required later versions of the browser). But most importantly I just don\'t think its realistic to expect the development community to make sweeping shifts to some new technology quickly. As I\'ve mentioned before these things take 3-5 years, so its not much of a surprise that the stuff that was developed incrementally between 1996 and 1998 actually started to hit it big in 2000-2002 and really exploded in 2005-2006.','Story of XMLHTTP',0,'','publish','open','open','','story-of-xmlhttp','','','2011-09-27 12:39:15','2011-09-27 19:39:15','',0,'http://staging.alexhopmann.com/?page_id=110',0,'page','',5),(111,2,'2007-02-22 19:21:07','2007-02-23 03:21:07','Today I moved the site to WordPress.

From my perspective he is half right.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>His observation that Macs are everywhere is dead on. I bought my MacBook a couple of months ago and on most client visits I\'d rather bring my MacBook, both because its lighter than my Dell, but also because its the \"cool\" machine to have and you see them all over now.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>But Robert goes on to say that \"WPF/E and Expression and the fun workflow that Manuel and John show off won\'t matter one bit if you develop Web sites on a Mac\". I think this misses one of the key angles on the recent Mac phenomena- many of those Macs are running Windows, at least partially. The inflection point when the developer community shifted from a few mostly isolated designers running Macs to everyone carrying them around is pretty clearly the Intel Macs, Bootcamp and Parallels. This means that Expression, etc, run great on those Macs.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>Of course part of the sad thing is that both Microsoft and Apple are so ambivalent about this shift that neither is really capitalizing on it. Apple is the closest, but I get the vibe (I hope I\'m wrong) that Apple doesn\'t really want Windows to kick-ass on their machines. If all the drivers for Vista were 100% and Apple added right mouse buttons and/or a couple of keys to the keyboard, Vista on my MacBook would be a killer experience rather than a \"nice but somewhat annoying\" one. But Apple is conflicted because they fear that might diminish the MacOS.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>So, while it would be nice if Expression ran on the MacOS, the fact that WPF/E runs great there, and you can run Expression on your Mac hardware I think gets Microsoft 80% of the way there. Most of the Mac-developers and designers that I\'ve worked with lately all run Windows for various tools and IE testing and as long as they can run the results of their efforts on the MacOS, they are willing to work in both environments.</div>\r\n','Scoble on Macs in the developer ecosystem',0,'','publish','open','open','','scoble-on-macs-in-the-developer-ecosystem','','\nhttp://scobleizer.com/2007/02/28/microsoft-is-ahead-on-developer-workflow/','2007-03-03 05:58:10','2007-03-03 13:58:10','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/03/03/scoble-on-macs-in-the-developer-ecosystem/',0,'post','',0),(120,2,'2007-03-03 06:59:04','2007-03-03 14:59:04','<div>I\'ve never been a pro photography type.

I\'ve seen this mistake many times- for example Windows used to not have any clear \"top\" sku, or routers where you had to choose between either better performing router or better wireless. Its a really important concept that you need to have a \"this is the best we make\" model, and the bonus is you get to charge premium pricing for it. Microsoft really figured this out with Windows Vista Ultra- some focus accuse them of charging too much of a premium for it, but the mindset is that this is the version for the guys paying $500 for a video card, an extra $200 for the OS shouldn\'t kill them.</div>\r\n\r\n<div><img src=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/canontx1.JPG\" alt=\"Canon TX Camera Open\" /><img src=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/03/canontx1closed.JPG\" alt=\"Canon TX1 closed with lense protected\" /></div>\r\n<div>A week or two ago Canon came out with their new spring line and this time they have what I\'m hoping is the perfect camera for me.

For calibration purposes my MacBook is a 2.0ghz Core 2 Duo with 2GB of RAM, putting it fairly high on the CPU/RAM spectrum. The graphics are just the Intel integrated graphics (I think its the 945GM chip), and as I mentioned this is a MacBook running Bootcamp mostly so its native on the hardware, but with a slightly sketchy driver/BIOS situation since Bootcamp isn\'t officially released yet and doesn\'t unofficially support Vista. For both Vista and Office I\'m using the Ultimate versions.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>The overview of my experience is \"eh\". Overall so far there is almost nothing in Vista that I hate (once I disabled the User Account Control (UAC) security nonsense). The performance of the machine is fine, the UI feels fresh compared to XP, and Office has been a fine place to do all the usual Office stuff- writing documents, sending email, etc (although I\'ll admit that independently I\'ve been using Google Docs for that stuff more and more lately). The easiest way to wrap up my overall experience is that I\'ve got no intention to pull Vista off this machine, but despite having a couple of fresh Vista boxes sitting on a shelf at home I\'m in no hurry to upgrade any of my other machines. I should also mention that I\'ve made no effort to systematically explore the entire feature set of this huge new OS and Office package- part of the point of this write-up is that I\'m experiencing it as a (not-so normal) consumer and sharing my reactions with what I happen to encounter.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Things I Like</h3>\r\n<div>Windows Calendar. <a href=\"http://www.calendardata.com\">The Windows Calendar works great with CalendarData</a> and seems like a solid companion to Outlook Express (now known as Windows Mail), bring a nice calendar client to all Windows users. I wish the publish to web-site features had a better flow (it really only works with a WebDAV server set up as a file share, its hard to get it to work with a site like CalendarData), but especially given how late an addition this was to the product, it is really well done.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>Aero Glass. Some people complain that its distracting, but on the balance I like it- as we hoped when designing it, it is fresh, light and doesn\'t get in your way. I remember that we were really concerned about getting reasonable performance on machines like this MacBook with integrated GPUs, but it works great so far on at least the modern integrated GPUs, so that is a pleasant surprise</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>Hibernate seems much faster which is a surprisingly important improvement. I\'m curious if the hybrid flash-harddrives will make this even better.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>And the new games are kind of cool. I like the Hold-Em poker, and InkBall.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Things I don\'t like</h3>\r\n\r\n<div>This is not really Microsoft\'s fault, but the number of apps that have subtle compatibility problems is annoying. Firefox and Adobe Reader are two top examples that have been annoying. Firefox had some strange bug where it wouldn\'t load some sites on Vista and Adobe\'s installer was broken- I haven\'t had a chance to check if these were fixed yet. It also took a month for Microsoft to ship the Visual Studio update that is supposed to work on Vista, although I was running the one that \"doesn\'t work\" and never noticed whatever the issues were.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>Windows Live Messenger doesn\'t seem to work 100% right, which IS Microsoft\'s fault. On my Vista machine it continuously logs in and out if I was logged in on another machine. I have no idea what the problem is and it is not necessarily related to Vista, but since this is the only box where it happens...</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>The start menu- I\'m still not really used to it. Sometimes it seems faster since I can just hit [windows] and type something like \"cmd\", but often it feels very awkward to navigate. It feels like they were headed in the right direction but just never got the usability right. This problem is made much worse by some horrendous performance problems- the initial Window pop-up is always very fast but when you navigate to a folder there is often an unacceptable multi-second delay. Also the highlighting of the current item in the start menu as you mouse or keyboard navigate is way too subtle and it is hard to see on some screens / lighting conditions.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<div>The organization of the control panels are still very confusing. It feels like someone started to organize a few into a new taxonomy but left a bunch out so there is some weird combination of things being in old places, things being in new places, and overall its very hard to find the setting that I want.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Office</h3>\r\n<div>Did I mention Office? I\'ve been running the new Office too. I\'m completely ambivalent about the new Office, but I\'ve also got to admit that my need for hard-core Office features is probably quite a bit lower in my current role. I use Outlook, Word and Excel, all in fairly lightweight ways. I\'ve been lucky enough to not have to make any slide-decks lately. The new ribbon UI is fine and I mostly didn\'t have a hard time finding stuff in Word. Outlook\'s UI doesn\'t fit in with the rest of Office- its actually inconsistent within itself. The main window is classic menu bar, but when you open an email to read it, its with a ribbon. But the only thing that I really hate is that the next/previous buttons (the ones that are the most important of all when reading through your mailbox) have moved off into a weird spot in the top left of the window and are tiny compared to other nice huge buttons in the ribbon.</div><br/>\r\n\r\n<h3>Bottom Line</h3>\r\n<div>These are all fine products, and are actually reasonable releases if you manage to ignore the \"wow\" marketing campaign or painful 5+ years it took to build them. I\'m going to try to hold off buying any new computers until this summer with the new 45nm processors come out, but when they do I\'ll happily run Vista on those machines. I\'ll probably even eventually upgrade a few of my other machines once there has been enough time that I\'m confident all the key software I need runs on them (games + some wacky airplane data download stuff). To be honest, I\'ve actually come around and I think its probably a good idea for Microsoft to do Windows releases that are more incremental like this. If upgrades weren\'t so expensive, it would be great to have a nice refresh every two years that just feels a little fresh and has great support for the latest hardware.</div>\r\n\r\n','Windows Vista (and Office 2007) after one month',0,'','publish','open','open','','windows-vista-and-office-2007-after-one-month','','','2007-03-05 11:09:23','2007-03-05 19:09:23','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/03/05/windows-vista-and-office-2007-after-one-month/',0,'post','',0),(130,2,'2007-03-06 01:18:52','2007-03-06 09:18:52','<a href=\"http://www.tongfamily.com/laptop_hard_drive.php\">Rich writes about looking for a replacement laptop hard drive</a>.

Previous shows I\'d seen at the Paramount pretty much sucked because we were in seats or the crowd was just too mellow. Bloc Party\'s show redeemed the Paramount in my eyes- they put on one of the best shows I\'ve seen since Blur\'s Great Escape tour and are probably (for me) the best currently touring act out there.\r\n\r\nI\'d been getting to know the new album and the live show certainly helped. They did a bunch of the new songs and imbued them with great energy. Its funny when the album is better because of the experience you have at the live version. Maybe its not fair- the recordings should be judged on their own, but the experience of the live show and the ability of the album to call up that experience in the future is a very real thing.

Part of the redesign is moving to less frequent publication, with longer articles and photos in the print version and more of their former content moving to the web.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand I think its great that they are adapting to the web and agree that there really are appropriate ways to divide content between the web and print. But the way he described stuff that made sense for the print edition really missed the mark on some key points. He described the stuff for the print edition as being content of longer-term interest. I get putting longer articles in print (which they do also) since often that is a more satisfying format to sit down and do a relaxed extended read. But content that is going to be relevant for years is the worst thing to put into print vs. the web. A month from now the print edition will be in landfills and hopefully recycling centers (maybe this is too painful of a truth for the editor to grapple with?) and Google will just be getting around to featuring your online content. Online is the perfect place to put something that everyone will want years from now. \r\n\r\nThis feels like a classic case of old-media people not fully understanding the intricacies of modern \"new media\", the importance of the search engines to bringing in traffic, and the life-cycle of content on the web. It is easy to think of the web as like publishing a serial magazine except you can publish a new issue every day inexpensively. Old content then gets filed away into your archive of \"old issues\". That of courses misses most of the powerful techniques that people have been developing to expand their audience and reach.','New Republic Redesign',0,'','publish','open','open','','new-republic-redesign','','','2007-03-16 16:56:40','2007-03-17 00:56:40','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/03/16/new-republic-redesign/',0,'post','',0),(140,2,'2007-03-20 11:23:09','2007-03-20 18:23:09','There is quite a <a href=\"http://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/2007/03/19/good-news/\">discussion</a> <a href=\"http://www.ensight.org/archives/2007/03/19/this-no-money-in-advertising-meme-needs-to-die/\">going on</a> <a href=\"http://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/2007/03/20/no-money-in-advertising/\">right now</a> about growth prospects for startups, and <a href=\"http://lsvp.wordpress.com/2007/02/26/three-ways-to-build-an-online-media-business-to-50m-in-revenue/\">projections based on advertising revenue</a>.\r\n\r\nHillel\'s central point is more about the effect of taking VC money rather than the viability of advertising as a revenue source. In the specific focus on advertising revenue a couple of points got confused. First of all, the fairly low CPM numbers are typical for a low-volume business based on AdSense but once you get into more specialized networks, you should expect your revenue to go up. AdSense (as well as the affiliate networks like LinkShare and Commision Junction) are the bottom of the barrel in terms of advertiser spending. Its their throw-away money typically. \"Sure, I\'ll toss a couple of grand into the budget- if I get a site visitor for $.25, thats such an incredible deal, why not?\" Now, there are plenty of people advertising with AdWords where its their main thing, but they are themselves pretty small. Back in 1994-1995 I remember looking at ad-rates in MacWeek and just being knocked over that it cost thousands just to get started in that game. Never mind that I didn\'t understand the importance of repetition in advertising and how much of a waste of money running a single ad once is.\r\n\r\nHaving said all that, even assuming you are making more like $20-$50 CPM, you are still talking more than a billion page views needed to get to $50M in revenue. I\'m not going to go into any specific numbers, but when I think about the traffic that I\'ve seen on fairly successful sites in this wonderful web 2.0 world, and how many orders of magnitude they would need to grow to get to a billion page views a year, lets just say that its sobering.\r\n\r\nBut I don\'t think its a huge surprise that these sites individually aren\'t going to get to that lofty goal. But another trend that I\'ve seen in some of the VC plans is that the fund companies not just with revenue for their own operations (often the amount of money they give you has very little to do with what you need), but to also acquire other companies. So while its not realistic for an individual media property to necessarily make that $50M on its own, sometimes that money in the bank can be used to grow the company beyond just its own organic traffic growth and hiring.\r\n\r\nThe other factor to look at is the nature of the business you are in. Many of the online media businesses are not winner take-all. Just because one magazine is successful, doesn\'t mean that its going to be the only magazine on the rack. In these cases Hillel\'s caution about the effects of big funding (the need to push growth rapidly, shoot for not just big but huge opportunities) seem most relevant.\r\n\r\nOther businesses, even in the modern web world are winner take all. I don\'t really get what they are doing, but when you look at the pattern of investment from Zillow, they seem to be acting like they are in that kind of space. In those cases being highly capitalized and focused on rapid rapid growth can be the only plan. Build your business the slow organic way in one of those spaces and someone else will come along with a big bank account and buy the market. In these spaces the behavior of the company often seems non-economic in the early days. Its classic for people to be wondering what the heck they are doing and how they expect to ever make enough money to justify all that early spending. Of course once their target market matures and they own it, they then have a license to print money and just go to the bank and with hindsight everyone says that they were brilliant.\r\n\r\nThe trick is- in the early days its pretty hard to distinguish those situations from bubble-fantasy-craziness. Sometimes it just comes down to whether you know the people running the place and trust that they haven\'t lost their minds.\r\n','Growth, Money in Advertising?',0,'','publish','open','open','','growth-money-in-advertising','','http://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/2007/03/20/no-money-in-advertising/\nhttp://lsvp.wordpress.com/2007/02/26/three-ways-to-build-an-online-media-business-to-50m-in-revenue/','2007-03-20 11:23:09','2007-03-20 18:23:09','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/03/20/growth-money-in-advertising/',0,'post','',4),(141,2,'2007-03-20 21:49:50','2007-03-21 04:49:50','I don\'t have anything especially enlightened to say about this album other than that it arrived today and I\'m listening to it for about the third time and its great.

They aren\'t used in the traditional ad-sense model of \"sprinkle a few links\" on the page- if they were, the actual action rate would be so low that it would be a disaster for the publisher.

I think I said something dismissive at the time. I agreed about the main point but even though costs have gone down a ton, like a VC, they put a big investment into growing the brand of a given band and getting it enough exposure.\r\n\r\nOr do they? Today the NY Times writes that some record labels are signing acts and just producing two songs and selling them online. This really begs the question of just what value they are providing in this scenario- you have to assume they are signing someone to some pretty oppressive contract for probably less than $10k worth of value. Now I\'ve got to totally agree that their old role is obsolete. If they are like VCs, they are like some form of slimy VC that preys on the unsophistication of their target, preys on their lack of business experience, and meanwhile acts as a drain on society as they fight to maintain their old position through legal means rather than business smarts.\r\n\r\nAll that I can say is there is one clear sign when you have a dying industry (or business). When they start spending more money on lawyers and lobbyists than on product, you know the end is coming. I wish I could say the end is near, since all too often they can stretch out things for a long time causing much disruption as they do.\r\n\r\nOne other comment on this topic- personally, I do find the shift away from albums to individual songs sad. I like albums. When I buy music on eMusic, even though I have the option to do everything as individual songs, I usually buy the whole album. I often find that those other tracks grow on me later, they help me get a better understanding of the artist, and (here is the key) eMusic makes it all cheap enough that its no big deal. Its not some $17.99 per CD BS, its more like $5 (or less on the plan I\'m on), so its easy to take chances and collect every last song by each artist that I like. If there is someone in the music industry that doesn\'t understand this as a great opportunity to make lots of money, while being customer-friendly, they really don\'t get it.\r\n\r\nOr maybe this is just another way that I\'m clueless. I suppose I still don\'t get ringtones, so that counts me out as a judge of popular culture. Or as Art Brut say- \"popular culture - no longer - applies to me (x4r)\"...\r\n\r\n','Do Record Labels Exist Just to Publish 2 Songs?',0,'','publish','open','open','','do-record-labels-exist-just-to-publish-2-songs','','\nhttp://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/2007/03/23/record-labels/','2007-03-26 23:15:14','2007-03-27 06:15:14','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/03/26/do-record-labels-exist-just-to-publish-2-songs/',0,'post','',0),(150,2,'2007-03-27 09:49:56','2007-03-27 16:49:56','Fred Vogelstein wrote <a href=\"http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/15.04/wired40_microsoft.html\">an article in the latest Wired on Channel9</a>.

I\'d been planning on writing a few bits on PR from the perspective of the small-company technology person (ok, from the perspective of me). This whole thing is just the encouragement I need to try to break the whole thing down and rather than writing a long manifesto, I\'ll try to get this out in multiple smaller posts.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in the spirit of \"transparency\" I should mention that I spoke to Fred while he was working on this article. To the best of my knowledge I didn\'t contribute anything material to his story, but I\'ll just say that Fred has the admirable quality of wanting to get the context right when he writes about something and I\'m under the impression that he used multiple sources to try to understand how Microsoft actually works. To me this is just good, professional journalism, but in an environment of tight deadlines (pushed faster by the web) and a typical push for good juicy (juicy == sensational) stories it can be a rare thing.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite aspects of being a manager at Microsoft was the opportunity to interact with a bunch of interns every summer. The intern program is a great thing on many fronts (at least in the majority of cases where it is managed right- I\'ve heard of a few horror stories but they are rare). The interns get to spend a summer in beautiful Seattle, get exposed to all kinds of upcoming technologies, network with a bunch of people around Microsoft, and hopefully contribute to some real, eventually shipping product. Meanwhile Microsoft gets to check out the best and the brightest of the new crop of students with a 3 month interview.\r\n\r\nOne of my favorite experiences with interns has always been to expose them to some PR basics. They come in and having read about Microsoft in the press for years get to see the real thing from the inside. It is always fun to talk to them about how big the difference is between the reality on the ground and what the public sees. But it is also important to understand that this difference is usually not just caused by sloppy journalism. It is often a combination of both poorly we had communicated the real story, plus just how hard of a job it is to synthesize all this flood of conflicting information into a concise article. This gets to one of the reasons that I really like to talk to the press when appropriate- given how everyone is trying to spin them and how hard it can be to collect good information, it seems like a good thing to do my best to get accurate information out there.\r\n\r\nI\'d also like to be clear that I\'m not an advocate of <a href=\"http://mattishness.blogspot.com/2007/03/internal-politicking.html\">full-100%-transparency</a>. For example, lets take the Microsoft memo on Fred into context. There is really nothing in that memo that I find too surprising. Most of the contents of the memo are the kind of stuff that we all have floating around in our brains, just here a team of people needed to collaborate on something so they wrote it down. Sure I have a different interpretation of bits- the piece where they say \"it takes him a bit to get his point across\" I\'d more interpret as an aspect of his care in getting the story right. But it also goes as a perfect example why certain things like a briefing for a meeting or someones review document shouldn\'t necessarily be made public.\r\n\r\nIn David Brin\'s book \"Earth\" privacy has been essentially banned. Everything that anyone does is public record unless you do some explicit registration under the secrets act. This creates an interesting situation, but at least most people are aware of this environment and this makes them more careful about what they say/write. Transparency can be very destructive if it is thrust on you when you are unaware. For example, even though I doubt there is anything interesting in them, I would not be happy seeing Fred\'s notes of our chat published. I\'m not willing to publish the entire content of my email inbox, and clearly anything I post on here goes through at least some basic filter of what I think is appropriate for public consumption.

A couple of random observations-\r\n\r\n1) There is an incredible amount of construction going on. There is always a lot of construction in Vegas but I have never seen so much. And chatting with a couple of cab drivers confirmed that its more than in the past. They said that the construction companies are aggressively recruiting workers from all over the country. I guess given that the town still sells out for big events and conferences and that there is this increasing trend of building condos/timeshares on the strip its not surprising but it still seems pretty extreme.\r\n\r\n2) We had a dinner at Bouchon in their private room. The food was very good - although its not a place to get your mind blown with something new or amazingly good, its very strong and predictably good. The service was incredible- there were maybe a couple of rough edges, but the overall experience of them taking care of us in the private room and the orgy of extra deserts at the end were great.\r\n\r\n3) It is interesting to see the evolution of various trends in the casino industry. Over the past couple of years I\'ve seen lots of casinos having more and more of the lame continuous shuffle machines and the super-lame single-deck blackjack (with the horrible odds because of how they change the pay-outs on blackjack). Someone like myself looking for a game with reasonable odds (I like 2-deck, dealer stays on soft-17) was usually out of luck unless you were willing to have a huge minimum bet. I was happy to see that TI has moved back to the decent 2-deck tables. At the same time I did notice though that their overall selection of table games were pretty small and the trend towards casinos being mostly slot-machines doesn\'t seem to have stopped that much.\r\n\r\n4) The pools at Mandaly Bay are still crazy. The pools themselves are still fun (although the construction sucked), but every chair available is staked out by someone so there is literally no place to put your stuff. Its also especially lame that people stake out a chair just by putting a towel on it- the staff should be much stricter about removing towels left on chairs with no personal belongings since I suspect many of those people have entirely left. Also, the Mandalay \"The Hotel\" is cool, but getting from it to the pool is crazy because you have to go way around. They need to make some sort of passageway so you can get to the pools faster from The Hotel.\r\n\r\n','Vegas Update',0,'','publish','open','open','','vegas-update','','','2007-04-02 10:30:24','2007-04-02 17:30:24','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/02/vegas-update/',0,'post','',0),(157,2,'2007-04-04 10:58:44','2007-04-04 17:58:44','I made a Coke-braised brisket for Passover Seder at Hillel\'s last night. <a href=\"http://www.recipezaar.com/15255\">I basically used this recipe</a> except that I doubled it (the brisket was 8lbs), and I used extra garlic and liquid spagetti sauce instead of dried. I also roasted some cipolini onions and small carrots for about an hour and tossed them into the liquid for the last 20 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe meat turned out super soft and juicy (cut with a fork, falls apart), but really flavorful. No cola taste that I noticed, just great comfort food. Also in the past I had tried cooking vegitables with a brisket for a longer period of time and they turned out gross- the roast + 20 minutes in the liquid thing worked out just about perfectly. I also used the left-over liquid as a gravy/table sauce. It felt a little thin to call it gravy but was still nice.\r\n\r\n','Cooking- Coke Brisket',0,'','publish','open','open','','cooking-coke-brisket','','','2007-04-04 10:58:44','2007-04-04 17:58:44','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/04/cooking-coke-brisket/',0,'post','',0),(158,2,'2007-04-04 13:19:42','2007-04-04 20:19:42','<a href=\"http://www.addonics.com/products/flash_memory_reader/ad44midecf.asp\">Addonics has shipped a new CF to 2.5\" IDE adapter</a>.

Unlike my disaster at the PDC \'03 I\'m prepared, but of course the format is very strict and so its not clear how effective I\'m going to be getting across some information in 5 minutes of 20 slides each for an exact 15 seconds. Its a pretty rough format.\r\n\r\nWhen I learned this stuff it was in a 3 day course. So the 3 days -> 5 minutes thing is an obvious limitation. Compared to the initial write-up of the topic and first draft of my slides I\'m not going to spend as much time as I thought on some side topics like comparing aircraft and car engines and I had to cut my slides on magnetos / timing. I just realized as I went over the talk many times that trying to squeeze that extra stuff in there really was limiting my ability to get across the more central points. The whole thing is still a fire-hose of information.\r\n\r\nI\'m excited, it should be cool.\r\n','Ignite Seattle',0,'','publish','open','open','','ignite-seattle','','','2007-04-05 10:46:05','2007-04-05 17:46:05','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/05/ignite-seattle/',0,'post','',0),(161,2,'2007-04-08 21:22:18','2007-04-09 04:22:18','I thought my talk at <a href=\"http://www.igniteseattle.com/\">Ignite 3</a> went really well. It was <a href=\"http://ribonucleoblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/06/ignite-seattle-iii/\">really nice of Sasha to say that my talk had the most interesting content</a>. I\'ve seen several posts that echoed my thoughts that Jordan Schwartz\'s talk on bees was very entertaining and there were several other really cool talks. I was a bit disappointed by a few talks that were too straight forward pitches for peoples companies/products. Sure I suppose I could have gotten up and talked about <a href=\"http://www.launch21.com/\">the latest in software development and Launch21</a> but it didn\'t seem like the right thing for the audience.\r\n\r\nBruce\'s talk on prison was also interesting, although it suffered just a tiny bit from expectation-setting. The title/topic was so  attention getting that his talk (on teaching CS classes in a couple of prisons in Massachusetts) was, while very interesting, a slight let-down.\r\n\r\nThe logistics were overall way better. It was crowded but there was a good set of chairs and it was well organized. There was some last minute complication getting the video projector working right but Jesse and the other folks running the show did a great job pulling it all together.\r\n\r\nI also like the format of the talks. It is pretty frustrating trying to design a talk that works in 5 minutes, but the results can be pretty cool. A couple of tips-\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Focus. 5 minutes is enough time to almost get across 1 point, maybe 2 if you stretch it. This focus can be a good thing if you embrace it. I wanted to talk about engine timing, magnetos, more about prop speed controls, and a bunch of other things, but frankly if I had it probably would have quickly bored people who don\'t actually deal with the details of flying airplanes.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>No text. Or almost no text on your slides. At 15 seconds per slide no one has time to read them anyway, and they limit your flexibility as a presenter. Show some engaging pictures / graphs / graphics for each slide and focus on using your talking to make your verbal points.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Practice. You don\'t need to over practice, but it probably needs more practice than the typical 30 minute talk does. Most of us can give a 30 minute presentation on a topic we know well pretty cold. To get it into 5 minutes and get the transitions from slide to slide right you probably need to go through it 5-20 times.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>Think about the audience. This applies to any talk, but for this venue, consider that no topic will be directly meaningful to everyone (unlike a talk at the Exchange conference where I bet the entire audience cares about Exchange). So keep it entertaining and try to relate it something that a broad group of geeks will be interested in. Your topic might not be directly relevant to them, but they typically care about knowing interesting stuff about how just about anything works.</li>\r\n\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n\r\n','Ignite 3 Thoughts',0,'','publish','open','open','','ignite-3-thoughts','','\nhttp://ribonucleoblog.wordpress.com/2007/04/06/ignite-seattle-iii/','2007-04-08 21:22:18','2007-04-09 04:22:18','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/08/ignite-3-thoughts/',0,'post','',0),(162,2,'2007-04-08 21:33:17','2007-04-09 04:33:17','I\'m working on building a few new computers over the summer and will try to chronicle some of the planning process here. Ideally I want to build a new PC for my car (to act as a music player replacing my existing HD player that has been broken for 2 years), a new main desktop for my office and a new Media Center. For the desktop (which will actually go under the desk or maybe in a cabinet) and Media Center I\'m planning to wait for the 45nm new Intel chips to come out so it will be at least a few months.\r\n\r\nFor the media center I\'ve got a few goals-\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Nice form-factor case. My existing Dell in a traditional large size Dell box doesn\'t fit where I need it. Any of the somewhat small-form-factor or media-equipment cases should work. I don\'t care about fancy media displays on the front of the case, I\'d ideally like the minimum size and easy to hide out of the way.</li>\r\n<li>Quiet. Its going in my bedroom so as quiet as possible is a high priority.</li>\r\n<li>Decent graphics performance. I probably don\'t need top of the line, but I\'ve got a 24\" LCD hooked up so I need something that can drive high resolution at HD-DVD quality. And that isn\'t loud and fits in my case. I\'m hoping one of the new NVidia 8600s that are rumored to be coming out in a few weeks might fit the bill. The NVidia 7600 I have now is not quite fast enough to do HD-DVD without flaws.</li>\r\n<li>I\'m assuming that 2GB RAM should be plenty. I\'m not planning on running virtualization, but it does need to be able to handle recording two shows at once, playing back locally and remoting to 1-2 X-Box 360s.</li>\r\n<li>I expect a quad-core 2.66ghz should do the trick on the CPU front. See above why I need plenty of CPU (especially given that remoting to XBoxes sometimes requires real-time transcoding).</li>\r\n<li>For hard-disk I assume I\'ll have 1 1TB drive, 2 if I happen to have room.</li>\r\n<li>I wish something like cable-card were an option but it doesn\'t look like it is, and from what I hear it barely works even when it is an option (its OEM-machine only at the moment).</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nSelecting the right case seems like a key first step and its a giant pain. I really haven\'t seen many options out there that are reasonably small, very quiet, have enough room for an OK video card + a tuner or two (possibly analog + digital), etc. There are small and loud boxes. There are big and quiet ones. Few that combine both qualities. Another advantage of keeping the box small is that its easier to reuse it somewhere else in the house in 3 years once this machine is obsolete. \r\n\r\n','Building Some New Computers',0,'','publish','open','open','','building-some-new-computers','','','2007-04-08 21:33:17','2007-04-09 04:33:17','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/08/building-some-new-computers/',0,'post','',2),(163,2,'2007-04-09 10:17:38','2007-04-09 17:17:38','Bloc Party has a new single out and I went to look for it on EMusic.

The <a href=\"http://www.zalman.co.kr/usa/product/view.asp?idx=232&code=029\">Zalman HD160XT</a> is kind of cool but costs more than $500 and I don\'t really need the little 7\" LCD touch-screen.

The space I have for the Media Center box is about 7.5\" high (and I need to leave some space for cooling) but either of these boxes should fit- the bigger one is 6.2\" high, the smaller one is an inch shorter but can still take full height video cards and 5(!!!) internal hard drives. The 160 is a bit less than $300 at newegg, although since I don\'t feel a need for more fancy stuff on the front of the case the smaller one (which isn\'t available yet) might be the right choice.\r\n\r\nThese have a reputation for being very quiet. If there was a smaller version with only room for a Micro-ATX motherboard and maybe not as many drives, that might be ideal, but maybe that just isn\'t going to happen.\r\n\r\nI also wonder if the BTX form-factor is dead.

The Raptors are relatively small expensive drives (about $240 for 150GB) that run at 10000 RPM (instead of 7200 or 5600) with fast controllers. It should result in faster boots, application launches, and general performance. Of course I want to balance that against system reliability. From one point of view there is no more painful experience than upgrading your boot drive and/or the drive that contains your \"Program Files\". Getting everything back into shape could take days and considering what my time is worth that is certainly worth a few extra hundred dollars.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/03/12/cheap_raid_ravages_wd_raptor/\">Tom\'s Hardware wrote a comparison of the Raptor vs. RAID arrays</a> for workstation performance. This article is useful for some data but the analysis seems really poor to me and it appears to me from the title (\"Cheap RAID ravages WD Raptor\") that it was written by someone trying to prove a pre-conceived point. First of all they use striping-RAID which I wouldn\'t touch anymore- the greatly decreased reliability is just too much of a problem since a failure one either drive fails the whole thing. Still, contrary to the \"ravages\" claim, a single Raptor still beat the RAID array of slower drives by about 50% on key synthetic tests and two Raptors demolished them.\r\n\r\nStill the performance advantage only translates to a 21.3 second boot time vs. 23.4 seconds or about a 10% difference in the real-world performance. This is nice enough to be worth considering despite the extra size, but another factor comes in- the 150GB is just too small.\r\n\r\nMy current workstation machine is using 235GB of 280GB on its boot drive. Program Files is 60 GB and the Windows directory is 8 GB. So this should fit in theory, but of course I\'ve got a lot of crap on there that I would probably put somewhere else given better planning. Windows applications are just used to putting their stuff in the normal places on C and every time you try to point them somewhere else, you suffer some strange issues.\r\n\r\nI\'ll also point out that this disk is not the initial disk I got with this system. I bought an upgrade drive which came with some software that let you transfer your boot disk to the new drive. The transfer worked. Sort-of. But things have never been quite the same. Icons are messed up, program associations are messed up, and its something I\'d like to avoid ever doing in the future. This makes getting a huge boot drive seem pretty attractive- even if I sacrifice 10% off various performance, never having to worry about having enough space for all that stuff sounds like a good trade.\r\n\r\nI\'m also tempted to set the boot drive (whichever one I pick) up as a mirrored array so I don\'t have any downtime from the system drive going down. In theory a mirrored array gives you better read performance (important for boot) since sectors can be read from either drive (but unlike a striped array you don\'t gain any write performance since each sector needs to be written to both drives).\r\n\r\nWith all these factors my current thought is to go with two 500GB drives in a mirror array for the boot and one bigger drive (1TB or a 750GB I have sitting around) for the data disk. 500GB should be plenty of room for Program Files, Windows and tons of temporary files, and the price per GB is best in that size range ($.25/GB for 400GB, $.30/GB for 500GB, $.40/GB for 1TB).\r\n\r\nThe irony is that in the end I wind up with a similar recommendation to that Tom\'s article, although with different reasoning and specifics....\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Hard Drives for New Workstation',0,'','publish','open','open','','hard-drives-for-new-workstation','','','2007-04-11 13:00:56','2007-04-11 20:00:56','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/11/hard-drives-for-new-workstation/',0,'post','',0),(170,2,'2007-04-11 17:41:37','2007-04-12 00:41:37','Several posts from Mac people have complained about the Vista virtualization license rules that basically say you can\'t do it unless you have the Ultimate or Business SKUs.

The video card industry has been a story of incredibly progress over the past decade with NVidia and ATI leapfrogging each other just about every year. These guys have been leaving Moore\'s law (which predicts 2x improvements every 18 months for CPUs) in the dust with roughly 2x performance improvements every 12 months for over a decade. The ability to apply parallelism to GPU operations has enabled them to beat the progress in CPUs where just adding more parallel execution has rarely improved raw performance.\r\n\r\nFor the past few months since the introduction of the GF8800 NVidia has been well ahead of ATI in raw performance, but the latest news is that ATI will be introducing their new generation based on the R600 chips within a couple of weeks. I\'ll be looking forward to the comparison reviews and will certainly wait until the new mid-range NVidia and ATI boards are all out. For my \"workstation\" computer I\'m looking for a fairly beefy card in the $300-$400 range that can do great 3d graphics and high-performance WPF on my 30\" LCD, and for the media center my goal is to get a nice card in the $200 range that is quiet and has enough performance to decoded HDDVD on a 24\" LCD.\r\n\r\nWhen the reviews come out I hope that they provide a bit more focus on driver quality. As high-end accelerated graphics has moved beyond 3d games (where one game takes over the full screen experience and 100% of the GPU resources) to media center experiences and driving core UI in Windows (the Aero glass UI in Vista), the importance of quality video drivers has become way more important. So far most of the review sites like <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com\">AnandTech</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com\">Tom\'s Hardware</a> tend to focus on just performance benchmarks. Lately they have added some noise stats which is welcome, but it would be great to have these guys come up with a good way to rank driver stability. Like I said- if you are running Vista, having quality video drivers can make the difference between multiple crashes a day vs. a great experience and for a media center box its just horrible when your TV stutters or even worse loses a program you were trying to record because of some failure.\r\n\r\nI\'d easily buy a video card from a company that put the effort into making solid drivers. Ok, maybe I wouldn\'t buy a card that was half as fast, but this is probably #1 on my priority list, and the reviews barely mention it at all. What makes this situation worse is that the way the reviews are done influence the way the product gets built, so this cycle encourages the vendors to ship buggy but fast drivers early on to get the best benchmarks and so the revewiers are actually hurting consumers by not focusing on this.\r\n\r\n','Video Cards for New Computers',0,'','publish','open','open','','video-cards-for-new-computers','','','2007-04-13 09:17:09','2007-04-13 16:17:09','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/13/video-cards-for-new-computers/',0,'post','',0),(172,2,'2007-04-14 16:27:57','2007-04-14 23:27:57','Today we hiked up Icicle ridge in the Alpine lakes region of Washington state right near Leavenworth, WA. Icicle canyon is a great area with tons of different hikes but many of them start out at higher elevations and are still fairly snow-bound this early in the year. However it is possible to start at the base of the ridge and that area is already mostly snow-free.\r\n\r\nYou start up a set of switchbacks. These looked a bit daunting on the map, but turned out to be less steep than Tiger Mountain or Mount Si. The trail was quite nice going in between some wooded areas and more open areas with good views. The whole thing would be about 9 miles and 4000ft gain to the next intersection but we only made it about 1/3 of the way in.\r\n\r\n','Hiking Icicle Ridge',0,'','publish','open','open','','hiking-icicle-ridge','','','2007-04-14 16:27:57','2007-04-14 23:27:57','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/14/hiking-icicle-ridge/',0,'post','',0),(173,2,'2007-04-16 15:40:29','2007-04-16 22:40:29','This weekend we headed off to Leavenworth, WA for the first rafting trip of the season.

These are priced in the $150-$230 range and should provide plenty of performance for the media center machine (I\'m pretty sure I\'m going to want an 8800-class card for the workstation machine). To me one of the key aspects of the 8-series of cards is they provide full decoding for high-definition video.\r\n\r\nI\'m a little disappointed that <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/video/showdoc.aspx?i=2970\" title=\"AnandTech on NVidia GeForce 8600 series\">the AnandTech write-up</a> did not include media-benchmarks or noise level measurements. I guess I\'ll have to wait for the real boards to hit the market for that info.\r\n\r\nI\'m tempted to get one of these to upgrade my existing Media Center- it should run fine in the existing machine and then I can move it to the new one once I build it. I\'ll probably wait for the new ATI (AMD) series to come out and then make a decision.\r\n\r\nAlso- PLEASE REVIEW THE DRIVER STABILITY. The only thing I could figure out on that was that its a total mess on the NVidia side with different drivers for XP vs. Vista and different drivers to download for each different board.\r\n\r\nAlso- <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com/2007/04/17/hitachi_7k1000_terabyte_hard_drive/page6.html\">Tom\'s Hardware reviews the Hitachi 1TB hard-drive</a>. The interesting bit here is that the read performance is very good and is creaping closer to the Raptor. Especially on Vista (where its smarter about moving stuff around for sequential reads) this should help with boot and application start times, although the seek times are still slow (which hurts performance for compilers and databases). Still given advances in RAM caching and memory sizes I bet a compiler is mostly working from RAM now for reads so this isn\'t the factor for a developer workstation that it used to be.\r\n\r\nMy only other concern is that this drive runs very hot- the hottest they have tested yet. The Hitachi drive has 5 platters which is a lot to cram into the 2.5\" form-factor and is probably related to the temperature. The recent research suggests that the temperature doesn\'t hurt drive life that much for the first 2 years, but does impact it quite a bit in year 3, just as the Hitachi warranty expires. Seagate has a 1TB drive coming out shortly that should hopefully have a 5-year warranty and that uses 4 platters which should run cooler and in theory might even get better read performance (due to higher density).\r\n\r\n','Hardware News- NVidia 8600 and new 1TB Drives',0,'','publish','open','open','','hardware-news-nvidia-8600-and-new-1tb-drives','','','2007-04-17 11:31:47','2007-04-17 18:31:47','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/17/hardware-news-nvidia-8600-and-new-1tb-drives/',0,'post','',0),(175,2,'2007-04-17 11:59:20','2007-04-17 18:59:20','There is one confusing point in some of the write-ups on the 8600. One of the key features in the new cards is the improved media playback performance, but its not clear if the 8800 also has this capability. If not, its a pretty serious mistake for NVidia to have your top-of-the-line parts missing something key that the lower-end parts support. One key marketing strategy is that if you have a \"best of everything\" model, people will pay a big premium for it-Microsoft got this right with Vista Ultimate after screwing it up with XP. Sure, some people complain about how much Ultimate costs, but I doubt Microsoft ever intended to sell a high percentage of it. Still, they make a lot more money with that one to the same peope buying the $600 video cards or the people who would buy a Mac Pro with Apple\'s signifigant mark-up. Still NVidia is going to have a problem one their hands if their $600 video-card can\'t play HD movies as well as their $200 one can.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting alternative might be the 8500- apparently its about $100. Apparently its going to suck for high-end 3d games, but if it can do great media-playback (and it should be good enough for Vista Aero Glass) and can get by with passive cooling (which apparently the 8500 can) it could be a great choice. Often getting a quiet fan on your video card can be tough and they are the loudest parts in a modern computer often so this could be a very good thing.\r\n\r\n','NVidia 8600 Model Media Performance',0,'','publish','open','open','','nvidia-8600-model-media-performance','','','2007-04-17 11:59:20','2007-04-17 18:59:20','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/17/nvidia-8600-model-media-performance/',0,'post','',0),(176,2,'2007-04-17 14:30:24','2007-04-17 21:30:24','This is just too cool. <a href=\"http://ww1.whistlerblackcomb.com/p2pg/home.html\">Whistler is putting in a Gondola between Whistler and Blackcomb peaks</a>.

The performance numbers for the new Penryn chips look like they are nice, but just a little bit better at the same clock speeds. More troubling, while it seemed from earlier reports that the chips would be out this summer, the recent reports all say either \"end of this year\" or \"H1 2008\", both of which feel like they are way off.\r\n\r\nSo why do I care about waiting for the die shrink? When the transistors shrink, they can run from lower voltages and (given constant clock speed and features) consume much less power. They also let Intel come out with higher clocked parts, but even buying the same clock speed you can today you get a much more efficient chip, and hopefully prices also come down quite a bit since Intel can make more of them on a wafer. By waiting for this next generation you get (a) chips that are 10-20% faster at the same clock speeds, (b) chips that use 40% less power at the same clock speeds, (c) the option to increase the clock speeds by 20%.\r\n\r\nAll of this suggests that if I\'ve got to wait I\'m likely upgrading the video card in my existing media center box relatively soon (with that nice Gigabyte silent 8600GTS or possibly something from ATI/AMD if they come out with something even better) and holding off on the bigger upgrades until \"the end of the year\", whenever that turns out to be.\r\n\r\nGiven the industry\'s reluctance to ship something during the middle of the holiday season I\'m hoping that \"the end of the year\" is actually no later than October. And sure, by the time Penryn comes out, there will be another generation on the way with even better stuff.\r\n\r\nI haven\'t seen any news from IDF yet about improvements in Intel virtualization technology.

They lament that it won\'t really pass hard-drive pricing but to me this really isn\'t that big a deal. This is yet another turn of the process described in the book \"The Innovators Dilemma\" which maps the progress of hard-drive technologies all the way back to 8\" disks and the old-school platters. Each new generation is slower and more expensive than the previous one but expands out into new market segments and takes over eventually with efficiencies of scale.\r\n\r\nExcept that this time the new technology isn\'t slower. Storage capacities have improved amazingly, faster that Moore\'s law for decades, yet the drives are barely faster than they were 20 years ago (relatively speaking). This has a lot to do with basic physics- you can only spin a platter of atoms so fast. This time the new flash-based technology has the potential to be faster (at least on certain dimensions like access time) right out of the gate.\r\n\r\nFor more than a year now people have been talking about the upcoming hybrid hard-drives that combine a normal hard-drive with some flash used as an extra cache. Vista has some special support for these that can take advantage of the flash to put commonly used information that is needed for startup to make boot/resume and application launches much faster than before.\r\n\r\nBut it occurs to me that flash memory comes in different speeds too. I\'ve been looking into this for my upcoming new camera since for shooting HD video I think I\'m going to need the faster version of the SD card. But with true SSD drives you could do the same thing as the hybrid hard-drive, and combine some fast-flash (used for those commonly accessed bits) with a bunch of slower storage for documents, music, media, stuff you don\'t access as often and where the slower speeds are fine. Given how small the chips are compared to a 2.5\" hard-drive you should be able to cram a ton of memory into a laptop soon once the prices become reasonable.\r\n\r\nAnother thing that I\'m unclear about is the power-usage. I\'m hoping that these SSDs will be much lower power than a spinning hard-drive. Just because they are solid-state doesn\'t mean that they are low-power. CPUs, GPUs, and RAM manage to use lots of power all the time. But I\'m hoping that given that flash can store information with the power off that the power-usage is just proportional to the amount of reading and writing going on, not the amount stored. This lets you add as much extra storage to your machine as you can fit with no extra power consumption.\r\n\r\nAll in all it looks reasonable to expect that fully SSD-based laptops will be a speciality item in 2007 (Dell just introduced two models this week), common in 2010, and by 2012-2013 I wouldn\'t be surprised if it will be rare to have spinning disks in a laptop/portable computer.\r\n\r\n','SSD Progress and a New Kind of Hybrid Drive',0,'','publish','open','open','','ssd-progress-and-a-new-kind-of-hybrid-drive','','','2007-04-25 10:04:20','2007-04-25 17:04:20','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/04/25/ssd-progress-and-a-new-kind-of-hybrid-drive/',0,'post','',0),(183,2,'2007-04-30 21:32:39','2007-05-01 04:32:39','Another year, another trip to the great Coachella music festival.

For a bit I was afraid that I wouldn\'t be able to walk and go to the shows at all but Kelly was able to patch me up enough to limp around.\r\n\r\nThis year they added a third day and between how tired we have been from work lately, how overwhelming a 3-day thing starts to feel and maybe just becoming a bit jaded we didn\'t get to the first day until fairly late.

I was a little disappointed that we missed the first half of the Jesus and Mary Chain set but the second half was really good and it was cool to see Just Like Honey and Reverence live, loud and with the appropriate piercing feedback.\r\n\r\nAfter that we saw Jarvis Cocker. Jarvis is the Austin Powers of Britpop. He was funny, dramatic, and shook his butt at the audience. Overall a really fun set, and while it was slightly disappointing that he didn\'t do anything from Pulp, his new material is really good.\r\n\r\nFinally we saw some of Interpol.

I\'d been doing <a href=\"http://www.launch21.com/category/launche/\">a bunch of work in WPF/E (the old name for Silverlight)</a> and the new release seems like some solid progress.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting parts of the announcement is the support for a mini-CLR that runs .NET code anywhere Silverlight runs. It appears to have a very limited set of the framework libraries. Given that the install is only 4MB this isn\'t a surprise. But my big question is how will interop work between the .NET and Javascript work.\r\n\r\nOne of the bigger problems we had with Avalon (WPF) meeting the needs of web developers is that we changed the app model all around. You weren\'t serving dynamic script from the server, the app had to be compiled and use web-services or something to talk back to the server. WPF/E was interesting because you could use some of the same graphic capabilities while sticking with a conventional Javascript coding model.\r\n\r\nIf Silverlight supports good Javascript / .NET interop you could have the best of both worlds. Build controls, etc, in .NET where the cleaner programming model and better performance helps. And script the logic and flow of your app in Javascript using conventional web tools. I haven\'t had a chance to dig into the new release but it looks promising.\r\n\r\nI\'ve also got my fingers crossed for an announcement of linux support. I can think of about 5 or 6 projects that could use Silverlight if there were support for running on linux.\r\n\r\n','Silverlight- .NET and JavaScript interop?',0,'','publish','open','open','','silverlight-net-and-javascript-interop','','','2007-05-03 09:24:48','2007-05-03 16:24:48','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/05/03/silverlight-net-and-javascript-interop/',0,'post','',0),(187,2,'2007-05-04 15:12:16','2007-05-04 22:12:16','I\'ve had the new Canon TX1 out of its box for all of an hour now so this is a very quick set of first impressions. When people see it their first reaction is that its a video camera. Its interesting that this form factor looks like video camera first and people are surprised that its a capable still-photo camera too.\r\n\r\nFirst a couple of reactions about the form factor. This is a little bit of a disappointment. Because the camera is so small you only have room for about two fingers to hold it under the lens. The power button is in a weird spot on the side and much worse the trigger is in a weird spot on the top. To shoot still photos I need to hold it with what feels like a very unnatural grip. For shooting movies the controls feel a bit better since the record button is on the back right where your thumb would be and so is the wide angle/telephoto toggle.\r\n\r\n<div><iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=lancairtalk-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B000NK6DZI&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe></div>\r\n\r\n\r\nOverall still photo quality seems good. Low light seems a bit better than my previous camera (Canon SD550) although still far from even acceptable. There is a special indoor mode that helped a bit more too. The test photos I took were much better in terms of reduced bluring- the image stabalization seems to be working really well (or maybe that is some placebo effect). I did have a problem using the zoom indoors with it not focusing correctly.\r\n\r\nThere is a new super-macro mode that lets you focus from 0-10cm. I took a couple of test shots with this and it is pretty damn awesome. Should be great for some of the flower and food photos that I like to take.\r\n\r\nI shot a couple of test movies and the results looked pretty great. I bought a 8GB flash card for $60 from NewEgg but its the slow kind so in the HD mode I can only shoot about 30 seconds before it quits. Unlike the old camera it at least gives you a nice display of how close you are getting to running out of buffer.\r\nAt maximum quality settings I can get a bit more than 27 minutes of HD video onto one flash card and the bandwidth is high enough that as far as I can tell Windows Media Player couldn\'t keep up with the 30fps on my laptop (Core Duo 2ghz). At least so far I tend to not shoot video for more than small clips so the size shouldn\'t be an issue, although I do wonder if 32GB SDHC cards will be out soon.\r\n\r\n\r\n','Canon TX1 First Look Review',0,'','publish','open','open','','canon-tx1-first-look-review','','','2007-06-25 15:26:17','2007-06-25 22:26:17','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/05/04/canon-tx1-first-look-review/',0,'post','',0),(188,2,'2007-05-04 15:35:51','2007-05-04 22:35:51','There are lots of <a href=\"http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=7157\">write ups out and around about the new AMD Phenom CPUs</a>.

All the music I buy on CD I rip to WMA-lossless, and I also get a fair amount of high-bitrate MP3 files from <a href=\"http://www.emusic.com\">eMusic</a>. These files tend to be fairly large so I like to transcode them into 3 other directory trees- one with WMA variable bitrate that is about 192kbps, one with WMA variable bitrate that is around 64kbps for small capacity mobile devices like my phone, and a last directory with 128kbps MP3s for devices that don\'t like WMA.\r\n\r\nCurrently I use the \"Windows Audio Converter\" that was part of the XP Plus Pack to do the conversion. It lets me specify a source directory, destination directory and audio configuration and it goes off and converts the whole thing (skipping already converted files). The only problems with this scheme is that this is only a GUI-based app and I\'d really prefer a command line version that I can script and trigger automatically every day.

The AMD cards have even more disgusting huge power requirements than the top of the line NVidia cards and that doesn\'t suggest a good chance of silent (no-fan) versions of the cards. Also none of the reviews had any data on media performance- apparently the drivers are crappy enough at the moment they couldn\'t even get that stuff to work.\r\n\r\nIts really sad that it still appears to be a race to the bottom for driver stability.\r\n\r\nIn other news, NewEgg now has the 1TB Hitachi drive. Of course they are charging $599 for it at the moment which is $200 over the recommended retail price, so its still in a holding pattern.

I managed to shut it down, although that took probably 30 minutes. Then I was greeted with the joyful experience of it not successfully booting- each time partway through the boot process it would restart. Restore last known good configuration didn\'t help, safe mode didn\'t help. I was pretty sure something was wrong with the disk.\r\n\r\nSo I tried to boot into my Mac OS partition. No luck. I grabbed a Mac install disk and booted it to get to the Disk Utility. It wouldn\'t do any repair on the NTFS partition (no surprise) but it tried to repair the Mac partition. The first time it took about 20 minutes before it decided that it failed and after that it failed quickly. Given this I decided I probably had a bad disk and looked into my warranty options.\r\n\r\nMy warranty was still valid and I looked for a place to contact Apple support online. I hate talking to people on the phone if I can help it. No such luck, but they did mention you can bring it in to the \"Genius Bar\" at a local Apple store. This sounded like an interesting option so I signed up for an appointment the next day (today).\r\n\r\nOne note on the appointment sign-up. This was a very well executed web app. It would have let me sign in with my Apple ID, but it was also happy to let me proceed without signing up for an ID by putting in my name and email address. The whole process was very light-weight and easy and is a model for good web-design when you want to not scare away users with a heavy-weight process.\r\n\r\nThis morning I brought my machine in and checked in at the bar. I had to wait a couple of minutes but no big deal. The guy who helped me quickly took my feedback that I was a professional software developer (they need to gauge the technical level of their audience) but was still able to be helpful with troubleshooting things that I hadn\'t thought of. It did remind me how rusty my Mac skills have gotten. I can imagine a more frustrating experience if you warranty / AppleCare has expired, but the no arguments, we are just going to fix everything and work through your problems with a real live person is easily worth the $200 premium you pay for most Macs.\r\n\r\nI remember being skeptical about the Apple Store concept when they first rolled it out, but its yet another thing that have executed exceedingly well (ok, I don\'t get any points for being the first or even the 100th to observe this). The only real flaw in the support experience is that they don\'t really officially support Windows on the machine. To be honest, given the overall \"cool\" factor of their hardware and this experience, if they could really officially support Windows (which they might with the next OS release once BootCamp is official), their climb from 3-6% market-share would probably jump to 15%+. To be clear I mean really support Windows- pre-install it and have the genius-bar guys help you with your Windows issues on Apple hardware (with no attitude about how much better it would be if you had just stuck to Mac OS / how everything is Microsoft\'s fault).\r\n\r\nEven more importantly that 15% market-share would represent solidly capturing the high-end of the market. They would be able to do it maintaining their $100-$400 extra price point, and signing people up for multi-year service contracts at rates that Dell would kill to capture.\r\n\r\nI get that fully, 100% supporting Windows is a big challenge on multiple levels for any company, and its harder for some cultural reasons at Apple. But doubling (or more) your revenue strikes me as the sort of reward that would make taking that on worth every bit of the effort.\r\n\r\n\r\nBack to my poor sick hard-drive. I\'m currently installing MacOS on an external USB drive to try to recover the data from my Windows partition and determine for sure if the disk is hardware damaged or just a serious software issue that the Mac repair utility couldn\'t fix. Getting the Mac OS installer to install on the external USB drive was a bit of a challenge. <a href=\"http://db.tidbits.com/article/08405\">This article on booting from USB drives from my good friends at Tidbits</a> gave me the info I needed to figure it out. The problem is there are different master-boot records and the default ones that the Disk Utility put down didn\'t meet the OS Installer\'s specs and it wouldn\'t explain what the problem was- it just said it wouldn\'t install on that disk because you can\'t boot from it. The one trick was that in the Disk Utility I was selecting the partition and not the disk itself. When you select the partition you don\'t get the necessary partition tab with the options button you need. Click on the disk itself and all is well.\r\n\r\n','MacBook Repair Experiences Part 1',0,'','publish','open','open','','macbook-repair-experiences-part-1','','','2007-05-17 12:35:14','2007-05-17 19:35:14','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/05/17/macbook-repair-experiences-part-1/',0,'post','',0),(199,2,'2007-05-21 16:19:45','2007-05-21 23:19:45','Intel introduced the new 3-series chipsets today.

EXACTLY how it should be for a premium product like this, yet not sufficiently common.\r\n\r\nThe replacement hard-drive for my MacBook was in. They partitioned it for me so it was all ready for my boot-camp install. And it was all updated with all the latest patches. None of that \"I just bought a new PC from Dell so I get to run Windows Update for the next 2 hours\" experience. Keep in mind that the Mac has 100% the same thing if you install the OS yourself, but in this situation Apple took care of it for me. The replacement top-case wasn\'t there yet so it took them 30 minutes to figure out how to let me take the MacBook home even though only half of the repairs were done. But they figured it out and everything is good.\r\n\r\n','2.8 down, 1.2 to go',0,'','publish','open','open','','28-down-12-to-go','','','2007-05-23 00:07:16','2007-05-23 07:07:16','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/05/23/28-down-12-to-go/',0,'post','',0),(202,2,'2007-05-24 11:32:05','2007-05-24 18:32:05','While visiting the Verizon store to get my phone fixed the other day I noticed a little sign <a href=\"http://direct.motorola.com/ens/carkits/learn-T605.html\">about the Motorola T605 Automotive system</a>.

I also worked with the ObjectSpaces team as they went through several iterations forced by various political winds inside Microsoft. We were hoping that they were going to be a great compliment to databinding in Avalon (WPF). Ideally you could easily define some database schemas, create some .NET objects to represent your data logic, and then use WPF databinding to create great user interface on top of it. All resulting in an application with great abstractions so you can evolve the various parts independently as necessary.\r\n\r\nI had done some similar experimentation back in 1999-2001 (using Java to model an object programming layer first for Exchange and later for SQL). From my perspective the key was to not try to do a full complex \"object relational\" layer where you make things artificially automatic. Don\'t hide the underlying database, but make it a lot easier to interact with it.\r\n\r\nSo far the most effective version of this is pretty much the ActiveRecord library that is part of Ruby on Rails. Judy\'s Book also has their own version for the various sites built there, and I\'ve built my own as part of various Fast Carrot / Launch21 projects. Writing lots of custom SQL and dealing with generic records all over your UI logic can be a big pain, and you also get stuck with poor choices for where to put your business logic. Part of what makes these technologies contraversial is that the database purists want you to put all the logic in the database. You build stored procedures, triggers, or more recently .NET based custom types that live in the database. The advatantage of that approach is that you have a guarantee of consistent behavior no matter what client talks to your database. For certain OS or enterprise applications this is very important. For most of the web-applications we build on the other hand this is a non-issue and just makes building the whole thing a giant pain.\r\n\r\nI haven\'t had a chance to get my hands dirty with LINQ yet but I\'m hopeful that its going to be really cool. I know there were a bunch of neat projects brewing in this space so if they make the database side of the programming really interface with .NET in an elegant way, that could be a huge win for .NET programming.\r\n\r\n','Dare on ObjectSpaces, WinFS, etc...',0,'','publish','open','open','','dare-on-objectspaces-winfs-etc','','','2007-06-04 12:11:13','2007-06-04 19:11:13','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/04/dare-on-objectspaces-winfs-etc/',0,'post','',0),(219,2,'2007-06-04 14:26:45','2007-06-04 21:26:45','<a href=\"http://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/2007/06/04/the-cultural-divide/\">Hillel writes about buying photos of his daughter and the conflicts between traditional business models (selling prints) and our new digital world</a>. I thought I\'d add a few comments to the discussion.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the way he approached the photographer was destined to cause misunderstandings. I guess he knew it in writing \"It probably didnâ€™t help when I told him that if I wanted additional prints I wouldnâ€™t order them from him anyway, I would just scan the print I got and make more.\" Given that the photographer owns the copyright to the photos, even if they are of your kid and they sold you prints, what he pretty much said was \"I\'m going to steal your work\". Not the best way to help the guy work through the business challenges that he faces.\r\n\r\nI\'ve seen these same issues going on with photographers who <a href=\"http://www.snowdragonadventureshots.com/\">take photos of rafting trips</a> and people at ski-resorts. In the local white-water areas there are two outfits that take photos of you, <a href=\"http://www.photoreflect.com/scripts/prsm.dll?eventthumbs?event=06I200YR1V&b=0&t=-1&start=0&password=\">one that sells online and will sell digital images</a> and the other still takes photos on conventional film and only sells prints. I\'m curious to see how it all works out, but I suspect the digital folks are going to win- they are able to take 10 photos of each boat as it goes by at no cost so its much more likely they are going to get the great shot that will make the sale.\r\n\r\nAt Snowbird a couple of years ago we passed by one of those guys taking photos on the hill. I\'ve been by them many times but never bought a thing. This time we stopped by and there were actually quite a few shots that were much better than the ones I\'d taken myself (go figure, they are the pros, I\'m not). But what clinched the sale for them was that they were willing to sell me a digital photo for $25, or 6 for $100. Sure enough, taking advantage of the 0 COGS, helped them upsell me to the $100 package, and everyone is happy.\r\n\r\nI do think Hillel misunderstands in his evaluation that the cost of the printed package has something to do with the cost of the printing. The cost of printing photos, even 8x10s is (relatively speaking) almost 0 today. You are paying for the photographers expertise and the intellectual property of their photo (and for a copy of it, not to own the copyright itself). They just have a pricing model where they charge more for more reproductions and bigger ones, just like Microsoft charges more for 4 copies of Vista than for 1, and charges more for 1 copy of Vista Ultimate than 1 copy of Vista Home despite the fact that the exact same bits are on each DVD, just different features are enabled/disabled. In many ways this photography business is closer to software than either side has realized yet.\r\n\r\n','Buying Photos',0,'','publish','open','open','','buying-photos','','','2007-06-04 17:09:26','2007-06-05 00:09:26','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/04/buying-photos/',0,'post','',1),(220,2,'2007-06-05 12:20:06','2007-06-05 19:20:06','<a href=\"http://www.asktog.com/columns/071SubjectiveTime.html\">\"Tog\" wrote an article on subjective time, comparing my favorite punching bag American Airlines to Jet Blue</a>. I couldn\'t agree more with the suckiness of the experience on American and how slick it is that JetBlue does it better.\r\n\r\nThe amazing thing is that JetBlue does it better without charging more. If they weren\'t just as cheap or cheaper, all their better experience would probably still result in a business failure. For some reason most of us are psychotically price sensitive when it comes to airline travel. For example, it would be awesome if Expedia provided a nice search engine that did some sophisticated scoring of flights based on my airline preferences (Jetblue = +5, Alaska = +2, Southwest = +1, American Airlines = -10), fit to my travel schedule, total time for the flight, on-time percentage and other similar factors. They may even have such a feature, but I bet no one uses it, instead pretty much just going straight for the \"sort by lowest price\" view. (to be fair, Expedia does appear to have a nice interface now that shows best non-stop fare, 1 stop, etc, so they do make it easy to pay a little extra to avoid changing planes as much- it looks like this has improved quite a bit since I last saw it).\r\n\r\nHow does the airline industry get out of this trap? I\'d love it if there were some better choices in air-travel. For example a quick search shows that a flight from Seattle to London this fall would run about $800-$900. I\'m a fairly big guy so being crammed into the usual economy seat for that long is pretty miserable, but going up to business class jacks it up to a minimum of $3500.\r\n\r\nImagine instead that an airline could offer an all business (or at least JetBlue class of service) for $1500 or even better $1300. For an international flight I\'d jump at that in a second. I don\'t need the full cushy business class, but an Enconomy Plus or whatever would be great. But as best as I can tell this option pretty much doesn\'t exist- too many people just can\'t see paying an extra $500-$700 for an extra 12 hours of comfort and I fear that airline would be a failure.\r\n\r\nIts similar to the cilemma faced by photographer that takes pictures of your kids (or you skiing or rafting). I feel like Hillel is asking for them to charge a fixed $30 or $50 to take the photo and hand over the high-resolution image files. In practice, that is what I bought at Snowbird and will do for some of the rafting pictures. Then if I want an 8x10\" its $1.50 at Costco, not $20. But I suspect the business model is not that easy. I suspect the number of parents that would fork over $30 just for an emailed file are realitively low since you then quickly start thinking about the $0 COGS to the photographer and the value of the situation starts feeling weak. Is the professional photo really that much better than the one I can take myself? What am I really getting here?\r\n\r\nIts interesting to note that the business model here is changing first in the situations where you can\'t really take the photo yourself. I can\'t snap a photo myself of that big hit on the river. Its also much harder for me to take some good skiing photos, although I think I\'ve done alright. So those guys are more easily able to take your picture with no obligation and then they can hold the great \"moment\" hostage for the $30.\r\n\r\nIts quite possible that some segments of these photographers will just die out. With the advances of modern digital cameras its just too easy to take your own good photos at your kids ballet or theater performance or soccer game. In a similar fashion I hope that the traditional airline system dies out in favor of the JetBlue style approach. Again, its one of those situations where the system has built up so many walls around itself that they have locked themselves into a model that is almost impossible to evolve from within. It takes the outside forces led initially by Southwest and perfected by JetBlue to undercut and rebuild the industry in a new way.\r\n\r\n','Tog on Subjective Time, JetBlue, and Selling Photos',0,'','publish','open','open','','tog-on-subjective-time-jetblue-and-selling-photos','','','2007-06-05 12:20:06','2007-06-05 19:20:06','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/05/tog-on-subjective-time-jetblue-and-selling-photos/',0,'post','',0),(221,2,'2007-06-05 14:35:18','2007-06-05 21:35:18','I remember when the NVidia 7800GS AGP version came out and it was predicted to be the end of the line for AGP video cards.

However, other, less complex technologies could also do those other things so the team had to keep constructing odd scenarios that those alternative technologies couldn\'t accomplish.\r\n\r\n','Microsoft Back to the Future Spoof',0,'','publish','open','open','','microsoft-back-to-the-future-spoof','','','2007-06-07 12:58:07','2007-06-07 19:58:07','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/07/microsoft-back-to-the-future-spoof/',0,'post','',0),(224,2,'2007-06-07 22:44:10','2007-06-08 05:44:10','I decided a couple of years ago to scan all my paperwork.

Its funny- <a href=\"http://parallelsvirtualization.blogspot.com/2007/05/yes-you-heard-rightparallels-desktop-30.html#links\">they were hyping it up for the last couple of weeks for the 3d support, file copying, and snapshots</a>. I\'m sure those will all be pretty useful features, but for me the bootcamp thing was critical- since I switched to running Vista in Bootcamp I haven\'t been using Parallels at all so this is the big breakthrough in the new version.\r\n\r\nI installed the new version of Parallels and after a couple of days hassle with my activation key, I finally was able to start it up and create a VM pointing to my boot-camp partition. It proceeded to boot Vista- at first it looked like it was hanging, but as best I can tell it was just doing a bunch of processing. Sign in, and it does some device install and reboots again. After it reboots, it again is installing something- this time the Parallels tools. Next lots of \"Windows can\'t verify the publisher of this driver software\" dialogs appeared. This all took surprisingly long- not a serious problem or anything, but it does beg the question of what its doing for 30 minutes or so. The bigger problem was that there was no indication of progress so I couldn\'t tell if it was stuck in a loop or something?\r\n\r\nIn the end it rebooted and it seems like everything is fine. The Coherence feature where each window from Windows opens in an individual Mac window is wild. For some reason the \"Use Multiple Displays\" feature was not on by default for Coherence. In the end it appears to be working great, although the performance of my Windows apps don\'t appear to be in the same ballpark as they were when running natively. For example opening individual emails from Outlook appears noticeably slow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','New Parallels 3.0 for Mac with Vista Bootcamp Support',0,'','publish','open','open','','new-parallels-30-for-mac-with-vista-bootcamp-support','','','2007-06-09 13:42:40','2007-06-09 20:42:40','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/09/new-parallels-30-for-mac-with-vista-bootcamp-support/',0,'post','',1),(226,2,'2007-06-11 11:59:46','2007-06-11 18:59:46','Gigabyte now has silent versions of both brands.

Most of you out there are probably saying \"duhhhhh\".\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.mattcutts.com/blog/privacy-international-loses-all-credibility/\">Matt Cutts wrote a good piece on his reactions to Privacy International\'s rating of Google\'s privacy as the worst</a>. And I agree with most of his points (with a disclaimer that I\'m not an expert so I don\'t know first-hand which specific claims are true or false). However, the bigger story is that Google is going through a similar transition to what Microsoft dealt with in the late 90s when you have an internal group of people dealing with a widening perception gap between themselves and the greater community.\r\n\r\nNow, Microsoft didn\'t have a tag-line like \"don\'t be evil\", but for the most part I personally witnessed very little of the kind of thing that people complained about as Microsoft\'s evil practices. Sure, we competed vigorously with each products direct competitors, but that\'s just business/life. I can\'t vouch for other parts of Microsoft like the sales teams or licensing, but for the technical folks in product development, we were all about building great products for our customers and trying to do some great technical innovation. When people started bashing us in public our reaction was very much like Matt\'s. We were just doing the same stuff we had always done, doing the same stuff that all the other competitors had been doing, and now all of the sudden we were the evil empire and everyone was out to tear us down, usually (it seemed) unfairly. We would go build something cool and do the quick to market thing, and then get roasted over some security hole, or privacy implication, or impact on some strange enterprise scenario. We would sit around at lunch and gripe about how unfair it was that we got horrible press on some obscure security bug, yet some major hole from someone else got barely a blip of attention.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of things going on at Google right now that relate to the extra scrutiny they are getting and some advice that I wish we could have figured out at Microsoft back in 1997 before it all got much worse.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, suck it up. This is an inevitable result of being on top. The way the press and public treats you changes, and you just need to accept that. David vs. Goliath is the most popular story that the press likes to repeat over and over. Folks at Microsoft suddenly realized that while we had thought we were David (Exchange was #2 to Lotus Notes at the time for example), everyone else thought we were Goliath. Once you realize that everyone thinks of you as Goliath you need to do your best to focus on being the gentle giant. David gets to whine about how tough his situation is, Goliath doesn\'t.\r\n\r\nSecond, realize that now that you are on top, you need to execute to a higher standard. Its not just good enough to be more careful than the other guy, you need to lead. Its assumed you have the best infrastructure, best ability to execute so the scrappy \"lets throw something out there and see how people react to it\" stuff doesn\'t fly anymore in the press. If you need any more evidence of both this point and the previous one, I\'ll just point out that there was a nice long segment on the Daily Show with Jon Stewart about the Google Street Views feature. To me Google Street Views is fairly innocuous- it doesn\'t show anything that isn\'t technically in the public sphere, but it has been roasted across the board. If some scrappy start-up did this feature the reaction wouldn\'t be nearly the same.\r\n\r\nOf course one implication of the previous point is that you now can\'t be as agile, or at least its a lot harder. Microsoft hasn\'t been slower just for the fun of it, but because they had already learned this lesson, at least somewhat.\r\n\r\nFinally Google has one unique problem here. Google\'s main initiative on things like these privacy issues are is \"don\'t be evil\" slogan. However, while I hear that the communication inside Google is amazingly open and transparent, Google is a very secretive organization with respect to the rest of the world. Matt is one of the few exceptions, which certainly relates to why his blog is one of the more popular ones on the Internet. So the rest of the world hears a slogan like \"don\'t be evil\" but doesn\'t get to see how things actually work. What measures are being taken to make sure that the log files (which have personal information for 18-24 months) are kept safely? Who does information actually get shared with? What policies really are keeping this stuff private? Could a Google employee look at my private Google Spreadsheet \"just to debug something\"? I\'d assume not, but we don\'t really know. Or maybe even if they can\'t look at my spreadsheet, can they do aggregate analysis of all the data that might leak keywords or something that is confidential?\r\n\r\nSo it all comes down to Google asking us to \"trust us, we won\'t be evil\". But given a society where the administration asked us to trust them that they wouldn\'t break any civil liberties protections in their pursuit of terrorism (and their political enemies), most people are understandably a little bit skeptical. What happens the first time the Google execs are looking at the possibility of missing a quarterly earnings target? They have had an awesome run of growth, but the more you grow, the harder further growth gets, and the temptation to bend a few rules, cross a few lines to keep that stock price afloat/rising becomes incredible. Keep in mind, that while you can argue that Bill Gates, Sergei and Larry don\'t personally care about the incremental net worth, many people in their organizations DO, and they all know that if it goes south they risk the whole organization unraveling and any of these guys would resort to extreme measures to stop that from happening.\r\n\r\nAll in all my best wishes are with the Google guys on this one. They have built a great company amazingly quickly and have so far had a decent track record getting out in front of other growth issues faster that Microsoft did, although at the same time their growth has been so meteoric that they have to react even faster. It will be interesting to observe how they tackle this- come to embrace that they are a big company and adapt to that, find some novel way to tackle this huge business challenge, or ignore the whole thing and go down in flames (or at least suffer a little bit).\r\n\r\n','Google is a Big Company Now (Google and Privacy)',0,'','publish','open','open','','google-is-a-big-company-now-google-and-privacy','','','2007-06-11 13:48:48','2007-06-11 20:48:48','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/11/google-is-a-big-company-now-google-and-privacy/',0,'post','',1),(228,2,'2007-06-14 13:00:27','2007-06-14 20:00:27','In a reversal of the usual \"Boeing or Airbus builds it and the airlines get to pick between the two\" model, <a href=\"https://www.easyjet.com/EN/News/easyjet_ecojet.html\">EasyJet, a European low-cost airline has proposed a new aircraft design</a>. I wonder if this is also a symptom of the reduced competition from only really having two manufacturers. It departs from the traditional of these two organizations in some really important ways and is telling about how the big guys aren\'t innovating enough in aircraft design (although the 787 comes close).\r\n\r\nEasyJet flies lots of short-hop routes and they presumably know that cruise speed has little impact on gate-to-gate time for most passengers. Fly 50 knots slower and you save a TON of fuel. Also by going with an unducted turbine (its not clear what the difference is between this and a turbine-driven propeller) you get better efficiencies in the mid-altitudes where there is a ton less traffic and less climb and descent times. Those atltitudes are fairly empty because traditional ducted jet engines are really inefficient until you get up almost to 30,000 feet.\r\n\r\nCombine that with a composite design (like the 787 but it sounds like they are taking it further more like my Columbia), and a relatively small passenger capacity (for lots of direct flights, shorter bording / exit times) and it seems like you have a real winner. They seem to think they can get Boeing ot Airbus to build it by 2015. I hope those guys are paying attention since it seems like an airplane like this could be a real successor to the 737 (which so far is pretty much the most successful commercial aircraft design in history on a number of metrics from safety to production).\r\n\r\nMeanwhile there was an interesting program on NPR this morning about the \"overloaded air traffic system\". While I grant that there are some choke points where things get overloaded, it was really disappointing to see the bullshit from the representative of the Airline Transport Association. Most of the time, in most of the country there is plenty of extra capacity (although I\'ll grant that the controllers are probably overworked and that we potentially have a serious issue with mass retirements over the next couple of years).\r\n\r\nThe ATA, representing the major airlines, is creating a \"crisis\" here to mask the incompetence of their larger members. The big airlines are so out of control for a number of reasons, including poor systems, business model flaws (the crazy pricing system), their hub system, and others, that they are flailing around to blame others.\r\n\r\nLet me give some examples- I\'ve looked at the arrival schedules at the major airports and the same airline will have 100 airplanes arriving in the same 30 minutes. Go figure they have some traffic problems? They are surprised they have delays from this? They also haven\'t figured out how to spread to the other feeder airports in a meaningful way. They love to complain about General Aviation (GA) as being part of the blame, but for the most part we are using the OTHER 5000 airports across the country and are in completely different sets of altitudes (at least until that EasyJet design comes into play).\r\n\r\nAmerican Airlines is so incompetent that I have witnessed multiple incidents of an airplane arriving only to have no ground crew to meet it and bring it into the gate. Their overall network of flights is so complicated and messed up that every little delay they have cascades into others. You could hope they could figure out how to not have 40 airplanes push-back to taxi for departure at the exact same time at a major airport, possibly even requiring the different airlines to coordinate a bit? But not only can\'t they do that, they can\'t even figure it out within the same airline- I don\'t get why I frequently see a line of 10 American jets wasting fuel in a line out there waiting to depart.\r\n\r\nSo the ATA guy blames it on the ATC running on \"world war 2 technology\". Scary old stuff like radar. What\'s so wrong about radar? The modern radar is displayed on fairly new terminals that give the controller lots of data, that automatically identify aircraft by N-number, and all that stuff. Radar is a very reasonable technology to use in conjunction with other stuff, and while granted there have been hiccups in deploying some of the new systems, its just obnoxious the way they try to pass it off as ancient.\r\n\r\nThings won\'t really get better for air travel in this country until the old air carrier system dies for real and is replaced by the nimble new-guys. Let\'s hope that congress can resist continuing to bail these guys out and prolong the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','EasyJet Designs a New Airplane',0,'','publish','open','open','','easyjet-designs-a-new-airplane','','','2007-06-14 13:00:27','2007-06-14 20:00:27','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/14/easyjet-designs-a-new-airplane/',0,'post','',0),(229,2,'2007-06-25 13:46:25','2007-06-25 20:46:25','<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2007/06/22/seagate-unveils-turmoil-proof-ee25-2-hard-drive/\">Via Engadget</a> <a href=\"http://www.seagate.com/ww/v/index.jsp?locale=en-US&name=null&vgnextoid=0f55b14d07133110VgnVCM100000f5ee0a0aRCRD\">Seagate has introduced a 2.5\" drive, the EE25.2 that packs 80GB and is good to 16,000 feet</a>.

Saturday night we had dinner at <a href=\"http://www.mgmgrand.com/dining/joel-robuchon-at-the-mansion-french-restaurant.aspx\">Robuchon\'s \"The Mansion\" at the MGM</a>. I\'ve been to <a href=\"http://www.mgmgrand.com/dining/atelier-joel-robuchon-french-restaurant.aspx\">L\'atelier de Joel Robuchon</a> several times and its been pretty much my favorite dining experience in the country (or at least up in the top couple), so trying out Robuchon\'s high-end place was pretty exciting.\r\n\r\nOverall the meal was fantastic. From the excellent service, to the selection of 10 kinds of breads (including one with bacon! Bacon goes with everything...), to the candy selection at the end with like 40 different choices of little bites, it was a great, over the top experience. I wasn\'t in the mood to take pictures of everything or take notes, but there were a number of highlights including some great caviar, a great combo of sea-food dishes, and a veal in herb-jus.\r\n\r\nThere are two other notes worth mentioning. The first is that I was surprised by what felt like a bit of kitsch with the meal. Maybe its an attempt to fit in with the general kitsch-nature of Vegas, or maybe it was just trying to be fancy somehow in a slightly clumsy way. One of the seafood dishes came out on a little net, with some shells. Many of the plates were beautiful, but some were just a bit over-done and distracting. Plus the music was pretty cheesy- again, we aren\'t sure if it was a plan or an accident but during some of the main seafood dishes they were playing a musak version of one of the songs from the Little Mermaid.\r\n\r\nIts kind of funny, but it makes a difference whether it was an intentional \"Vegas\" joke or just clumsy. When I first went to Vegas I pretty much hated it and it was years later that I came to appreciate it for all the cheese and neon and fake other-parts-of-the-world. Done in that context stuff can be really fun that would be just lame somewhere else like Seattle, Paris or New York. I\'m hoping that is what was going on.\r\n\r\nThe other note is that I\'m feeling pretty jaded/burned out on over the top meals. I suppose its not surprising, but a 16-course thing like this doesn\'t have the same wonder that it used to. It certainly isn\'t something I could do that often and 95% of the time I\'d probably enjoy the Atelier more for its cool and more approachable style. We also went to Craft Steak the previous night which with its focused, more simple preparations seemed more in tune with my mood lately.

To be honest, if you had asked me a few months ago I would not have predicted to find great stuff coming from him, but I\'m genuinely impressed by how insightful most of his posts are. Back in 1998 there was a book published by two business school professors called Competing on Internet Time that was based on lots of interviews with folks at Netscape about their wonderful business and technical innovations. Its unfortunate that this book was published more or less right away because from my perspective most of the insights in this book were complete crap. Many of their best strategies were (from my perspective being right in the middle of the whole Internet war of the late 90s) directly related to their downfall (not that going from $0 to $6B is a failure, but Netscape the company failed at most of their goals of that time frame).\r\n\r\nOf course its unfair to judge someone by their perspectives from a decade ago. I\'d certainly hope that people would give me a chance to show that I\'ve learned a few things over time and Marc\'s recent posts hit it out of the park. One of his most recent is on <a href=\"http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/06/the-pmarca-gu-3.html\">The Moby Dick theory of working with big companies</a>. I can confirm many of his observations. Working inside Microsoft things were often internally much more chaotic than our smaller partners would think and as he observes, we were usually focused on our big competitors (incidentally this is one of the things Netscape did wrong, putting itself onto the big competitor radar sooner than it needed to). We would work with smaller companies attempting to be benign- I can\'t think of a time that we ever really thought of a small company as a threat although it would be pretty easily to accidentally stomp on several of them (just through the availability of massive resource to tackle any problem that looked interesting to the big markets). Some times we were especially nice and would even explicitly discuss trying to watch out for the small companies. For example, when launching the technologies that become .NET 3.0 back in early 2003, we knew were were a ways off from shipping (although no one would have guessed it would take until the end of 2006 to ship) and wanted to be careful that we didn\'t encourage some small company to jump on board too quickly and potentially be stuck without products they could take to market. Still in the end there is only so much you can do, since you don\'t want to express doubt about the products you are launching and as I said no one internally would have thought it was going to take nearly that long to ship. Imagine the fate of the poor company that based their strategy around building on WinFS?\r\n\r\nOn the other side I can confirm the small-company side having observed how we dealt with our AOL relationship at Pure Networks. Pure cut a deal with AOL early on (before I joined) and that deal was pretty complicated waters for us to navigate, between trying to read the tea leaves of AOL reorgs, trying to understand their motivations, and of course the hurry up and wait phenomena where after months of ignoring us they would suddenly decide they needed something right away and then just as quickly go back into silent running. I do think management did a pretty good job of keeping people focused on not letting the AOL deal take over the direction of the company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Marc Andreessen on Startups Dealing with Big Companies',0,'','publish','open','open','','marc-andreson-on','','','2007-06-28 10:22:42','2007-06-28 17:22:42','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/28/marc-andreson-on/',0,'post','',0),(233,2,'2007-06-28 10:54:26','2007-06-28 17:54:26','I went ahead and bought the Gigabyte SilentPipe GF 8600GTS for my existing media center box. I noticed that the fan had frozen on the existing card in the box and that could certainly explain some of the failures of that machine. Plus I\'m hoping that this card will move into the new media center machine in a fairly straightforward way. It was a bit risky to get the Nvidia one before the benchmarks on the ATI Radeon 2600 XT came out. Those benchmarks came out today and the 8600GTS beats the 2600XT in just about every test, although for now they still only have the gaming tests (grrr). The media tests are yet to come, and those are the critical ones I feel for the cards in this price / utility segment.\r\n\r\nThe NVidia card from Gigabyte has been working great. The construction seems very solid and while it does take two slots it seems to do a good job of cooling without a fan. Somehow while installing it I managed to fry the on-board networking on my media center, so I had to get a card for that. With the two-slot video card I was out of normal PCI slots, but I noticed there was a PCI-express 1-lane slot that was open. Luckly DLink makes a PCI-express ethernet card which has also been working great.

It depends on the technology you want to deploy, it depends on the business requirements and costs of your situation.

On the other hand if you need a very dynamic environment where for one reason or another you potentially need to host multiple things in different virtual machines with the ability to scale things up (storage in addition to CPU), I\'m not sure that any of the existing hosting solutions will meet your needs. My experience with them is that they tend to have some degree of inflexibility, either in storage or in adding additional compute resources. If they do let you scale up your needs, are they as cost effective once you are using the whole box instead of a time-slice of it? Can they support load-balance across more than 1 machine when you need more resources than a single box can handle?\r\n\r\nFurthermore, its fairly important to look at these things in terms of the business situation. What\'s the cost of being down for 8 hours? What\'s the cost of having to do a few extra days of development to fit into the constraints of a hosting system? What\'s the cost of hiring the ops guy to run your own machines? How much ops support are you really getting from the outsourced host? These factors can go either way- if you have a good hosting provider that matches your technology stack pick, that can be a big help. Or Hillel and some other friends have even pointed out that it often is a good business decision to pick the technology stack based on what you can host efficiently. Realistically development for whichever stack is mostly similar (at least in efficiency- there are plenty of other issues) today, so pick the one you can run well.\r\n\r\nLet\'s analyze some cost issues. I had a cheap low-end hosting account but have moved most of my services over to a rack-server that I own in a data-center. My server cost me $1600 initially and I pay $60/month at the moment for my co-location service. This server is currently a 2x2ghz Woodcrest system with 2gb RAM and I\'m running 3 virtual machines on it for various ventures/web sites. I look at hardware investments are depreciating over pretty much 2 years. By 2 years from now its pretty hard for the hardware to be worth the space in the rack (at least the way I\'m paying for it- once you have a bunch of machines the math can work out slightly differently). However I did fairly carefully pick out a system where for an additional $1000-$2000 I can increase my CPU capability by 4-6x, RAM to 6GB pretty easily and I can put in 4TB of disk space. So the depreciation isn\'t straight, but I\'ll still write-off (in this model) $800 cost to the box this year. So my total monthly cost is $125.\r\n\r\nWalter was pointing out that you can get shared space on a virtual server for probably $35/month. This gives you 1/16th of a box that is probably much less powerful than the one I\'m running on and fairly limited RAM and storage (I think 256mb and 20GB. I need to double check with him on these stats). I\'ve seen others that give similar capabilities for more like $75/month. BUT (a) if you aren\'t using the extra capability, it doesn\'t matter. My box is probably averaging less than 5% utilization, so there you have it. (b) if the hosted box isn\'t fully used by the other people sharing it, you get to burst CPU higher than your 1/16th. So one of the nice things of my overcapacity on my box is the response time of my sites tends to be very good because the machine isn\'t busy doing other things. Its one of those interesting things with networking technology that once a machine is loaded requests queue up and they all slow down just like a traffic jam. Both of these situations can benefit from this, although in the shared hosting situation you don\'t have control over it- if other people max out their 1/16ths, your machine is under load, tough.\r\n\r\nThe other difficult factor for analysis is of course the human costs. My solution only costs $125/month (including hardware depreciation). But to get it setup I had to build the machine, go down to the data-center, and install it. I have to manage OS updates (security patches and similar fun), although conversely I get to manage OS updates and don\'t need to worry about someone else destabilizing my machine with a new version of something that I\'m not expecting. It doesn\'t take a lot of hours of work to make the economics look much worse. But just because someone else is doing the hosting doesn\'t mean that you won\'t get stuck with this- I\'ve spent way more hours messing around with the 1and1 servers than with my own- I\'m happy to say that since I put my data-center server up last December I\'ve never seen it in over 6 months and only very rarely have I had to touch it.\r\n\r\nSome other questions to consider if you are relying on someone else for hosting. What\'s their backup plan? I\'m not saying that mine is great. But if the CPU hosting your service dies, what happens? Are they actually going to be able to get you back online in less than 24 hours? Do they have redundant storage? Do they actually test the backups? Do they have the excess capacity?\r\n\r\nThe thing is- I\'ve never seen one of these hosting outfits that really explains clearly their procedures for all this stuff. Look, you are paying them less than $100/month. Sure they all say they backup. They have redundancy. But to be clear, without a detailed technical document explaining how they manage all that stuff and/or some form of financial arrangement where they compensate me for downtime (which would be unheard of in this price bracket), I just don\'t believe it.\r\n\r\nNow, the big disclaimer on all the above. This is a space where the technology and business framework is changing rapidly. Its pretty easy to imagine how services like Amazon\'s EC2 and other grid compute services will evolve into a space where they can really provide automatic, flexible, scalable pay-per-use computing that can be used to host commercial web-sites and web-services. I\'m just saying it smells like its a couple of years away from this stuff being really ready for many commercial applications.\r\n\r\nUntil that magic service really gets perfected another alternative suggests itself for small companies, although I\'ve never seen it work. I could imagine a bunch of the Seattle area startups getting together, investing in a 1/4 rack, 4-6 machines, and a half or quarter time ops person. With virtual machines, a bunch of folks that trust each other, and the right smart design you could pull of something that is both inexpensive, but also really robust, flexible, and safe. Just a thought.\r\n\r\n','High End Hosting?',0,'','publish','open','open','','high-end-hosting','','','2007-06-29 11:47:51','2007-06-29 18:47:51','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/29/high-end-hosting/',0,'post','',0),(235,2,'2007-06-29 11:45:52','2007-06-29 18:45:52','Cool!\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/glastonbury/2007/player/holdsteady.shtml\">The BBC has posted videos of most of Glastonbury 2007.

I was in to the Verizon store for like the 4th time to get it fixed. A couple of months ago the phone locked up and this is my third replacement. To be honest I\'m not sure if the issue is the Windows Mobile OS, the drivers that Motorola creates / their custom stuff, or bad hardware. But the latest phone was especially annoying- after about 30 minutes of being on it would lose its ability to send or receive calls. Try to place a call and it just locks up.\r\n\r\nTo Verizon\'s credit, their service so far has been very good with one exception. The previous time I was in there the tech looked at the phone and decided I had an old version of the OS on it and told me to go home and update it. When I did the update it just told me I already have the latest version. But other than that every tech has been happy to exchange the phone right away. Its a bit slow- they have to do some messing around with their computer and transfer my contacts. I brought a magazine this time so I wouldn\'t be stuck reading their lame promotional materials. But in the end they have been willing to replace them no question (except for that one guy) so I\'m happy with the service level.\r\n\r\nOn another note- today is iDay.

When you are building a fundamental long-term technology, it makes sense to project out a few years. The last thing you want to do is spend 5 years building something that is already obsolete by the time it ships.\r\n\r\nWe considered the expected progress of GPUs, CPUs, and many other factors. It was a bit contraversial since many of the things we were building needed my graphic horsepower than was commonly available in 2003. However I\'m happy to say that the GPU designers met (and exceeded) our expectations and in 2007 even integrated graphic chipsets have plenty of power to drive rich media experiences.\r\n\r\nOne area however disappoints me. We expected that LCD screens wouldn\'t just increase in size but would also increase in resolution. IBM had a display that was 204dpi, and some laptops were pushing 150dpi. My 30\" LCD at home is great and I love the 2560x1600 resolution, but imagine that same resolution in a 20\" display? Text would be soooo easy to read. Nice high-res photos and art would be beautiful. There are lots of great new huge displays but so far the marketplace has let me down and desktop LCD displays all have pretty much the same DPI, basically in the 100dpi range. Some laptops do better than this, but rarely exceed 150dpi.\r\n\r\nPart of the problem is a classic chicken and egg one. Super-high-resolution displays are hard to use unless the applications compensate and use more pixels for basic UI elements. But traditional applications have been crap at doing this right. Its a pretty basic thing they should support since people with accessibility needs often need larger UI elements, but its still very inconsistently done. At one point we hoped tht the Vista desktop composition could automatically scale old applications that didn\'t suppor this themselves, but its unclear to me whether that made it into the final release.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime support for Window management on a large display still sucks in Windows. Its much easier to use 3 displays with different windows maximized on each than doing a clean layout of your desktop on a 30\" monitor.\r\n\r\n','High-Resolution LCD Displays',0,'','publish','open','open','','high-resolution-lcd-displays','','','2007-07-05 14:49:45','2007-07-05 21:49:45','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/05/high-resolution-lcd-displays/',0,'post','',1),(242,2,'2007-07-06 10:59:39','2007-07-06 17:59:39','<a href=\"http://woodrow.typepad.com/the_ponderings_of_woodrow/2007/07/netsuite-ipoano.html\">The Ponderings of Woodrow writes about the upcoming NetSuite IPO</a>.

First of all it was a bit ironic watching a movie that covered the BS Blockbuster movies-on-demand (via the Enron \"bandwidth trading system\") on Netflix\'s real version.\r\n\r\nOne thought occured to me- the type of schemes that Enron used to do fake accounting to pump up their profits remind me of the kind of schemes that the Hollywood studios use (in reverse) to make sure that films never have a profit and thus they don\'t have to pay out percentages to various folks who have a stake in the film. For those that aren\'t familiar with it, having a percentage of the profit in a typical film has become a real joke since even films that rake in $100s of millions of dollars world-wide somehow always end up not making a profit. Strange that the studios keep paying for them when they never make any money?\r\n\r\nAnyway, post-Enron and in the Sarbanes Oxley accounting environment, I\'m amazed that they still get away with this stuff? Most of the studios are big public companies. I thought with all the new rules you weren\'t supposed to be able to pull anything like this off anymore?

Next week it will be possible to get a 3.0ghz Quad-Core 1333mhz front-side bus CPU, and sure its expensive, but will the 45nm version be any better?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=3038&p=3\">AnandTech did a very useful article asking some of the key questions</a> about the current processor lineup. For me the key questions were \"<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=3038&p=4\">does 1066mhz vs 1333mhz bus really matter for a quad-core CPU</a>?\" and \"<a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/intel/showdoc.aspx?i=3038&p=8\">For $266, should you buy a quad-core Core 2 Quad Q6600 or a dual-core Core 2 Duo E6850</a>?\". The former answer was \"barely\". Comparing two almost identical quad-core CPUs with the different bus speeds the faster bus had less than a 1% difference overall. The biggest difference was for some of the encoding tasks, which are good benchmarks for my media-center machine, but those were still only in the 4% range.\r\n\r\nOn the second question, the quad-core chip spanked the faster clocked dual-core chip for many of the media encoding, etc, tasks. This leads me to an interesting plan- I think I\'ll build a Media Center box using the Q6600 (2.4ghz quad-core) fairly soon. For this application I think it should be fine, I doubt that my earlier plan of using the 2.66ghz 1333mhz bus version will really make that much difference- at most about 10-12%, and for half the price (of the CPU).\r\n\r\nThe other dilemma is whether to both with DDR3 memory. The P35 motherboards come in either DDR2 or DDR3 versions (some have both). I was assuming that I\'d want to switch to DDR3 as soon as possible (so I could buy consistent memory between machines) but <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com/memory/showdoc.aspx?i=2989\">a recent review shows almost no difference between the two</a>. Fast DDR2 is better than slow DDR3, and today the only DDR3 available is slow and still costs 2-3x as much as the DDR2. Much as I\'m tempted to get the ASUS P5KC that has 4 DDR2 and 2 DDR3 slots, the rest of the board doesn\'t look nearly as nice as the normal P5K Deluxe so I\'ll probably stick with that.\r\n\r\nCPU: Intel Q6600- 4x 2.4ghz 1033mhz bus. $266\r\nMotherboard: Asus P5K Deluxe. $220\r\nCase: Zalman HD-135 Media Case. ~$275\r\nPower Supply: Zalman Ultra-Quiet 460W $99\r\nMemory: 2GB (1GBx2) DDR2 800mhz PC6400 CAS4 ~$105\r\nVideo: Gigabyte GF 8600GTS Silentpipe3- $183\r\nTV Tuner: AverMedia MTVPEMCER- $104\r\nDVD Burner: Sony Optiarc 18X DVD+R 8X SATA- $32\r\n\r\nTotal is about $1280 without hard-drives. One of the cool things about the Zalman case is it has 6 3.5\" drive bays. I\'m tempted to go with 4x750GB drives which should cost an extra $800 or so. A pretty hefty addition to the price of the overall system, but 3TB is nothing to sneeze at. The newer 1TB drives are nice but way higher in cost per GB. A more reasonable option would be to go 4x500GB, which only drops me to 2TB storage (still not bad), but costs half as much and I\'ve got the extra two drive bays for later.\r\n\r\nFinally once I put the system together I might need to buy an extra case fan. I\'m aiming for as silent as possible, but with no fan on the video card and all the drives its likely that the stock cooling won\'t be able to handle it. I believe you can upgrade the HD-135 case with extra fans- hopefully it supports the 120mm ones, although it isn\'t clear. Ideally it should be fine as is, but we will see.\r\n\r\nAs for the new workstation PC, I think I can hold off for now. I\'m at least waiting for the X38 chipset to come out and ideally I\'d like at least a 3.0ghz quad-core CPU and can wait for prices to come down a bit more on those (or the 3.2/3.4ghz ones to come out at the same price).\r\n\r\n','Hardware Updates (Why Companies Avoid Pre-announcing New Products)',0,'','publish','open','open','','hardware-updates-why-companies-avoid-pre-announcing-new-products','','','2007-07-18 13:55:56','2007-07-18 20:55:56','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/18/hardware-updates-why-companies-avoid-pre-announcing-new-products/',0,'post','',2),(251,2,'2007-07-18 16:52:14','2007-07-18 23:52:14','Two other notes on my hardware plans. First of all, the ASUS board says that it will support the future 45nm processors, yet several of the roadmaps show new Intel chipsets coming out and one of their features being support for the 45nm parts. I\'m curious what the real story is here?\r\n\r\nThe other is whether or not to try Vista 64-bit? On the one hand going 64-bit could make a future upgrade to 4gb of RAM more easy. And I\'ve checked and in theory all the pieces I\'m getting will have Vista 64-bit drivers. On the other hand its hard to imagine that the 64-bit drivers are as tested (not to mention Vista itself) plus I\'ve heard that 64-bit Windows was used as an excuse to lock down various DRM things that seem very consumer un-friendly. I will be trying out Vista\'s Media Center support- I\'m not planning on upgrading my existing Media Center box, instead I\'m building this new one and I\'m going to make sure its stable before I trust it as my main TV.\r\n\r\n\r\n','Hardware Comments',0,'','publish','open','open','','hardware-comments','','','2007-07-18 16:52:14','2007-07-18 23:52:14','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/18/hardware-comments/',0,'post','',0),(252,2,'2007-07-18 17:02:27','2007-07-19 00:02:27','<a href=\"http://www.brettonstuff.com/index.php/thai-food/massaman-curry/\">Brett posts a detailed recipe for Massaman Curry</a>.

The other 2gb is available to various kernel things. It is possible to adjust this ratio to give more address space to the application, but limiting the kernel can have some really bad effects.\r\n\r\nSo what happens when you have 4gb or 6gb of RAM in a 32-bit system? Can you use it? Granted, each application can only use 2gb (by default). But if your goal is not about some one monster app but rather to have a smoothly running multitasking system (IE- plenty of resources for those 4-cores you can buy now) can one app use 2gb, another app use 2gb and the rest split of the remaining 2gb (+ of course system caches)?\r\n\r\nPart of my goal is to have a system that can run a few VMs smoothly. So far my experience isn\'t great. The performance inside a VM is much better but running VMs (given that the things I run in VMs sometimes needs lots of memory) both leaves my base OS with very little memory, plus I tend to get lots of hanging in other applications. For a developer that wants to run Orcas betas in one VM, an IE6 image in another and linux in a 3rd, a fast quad-core system with 6gb of RAM seems pretty useful, as long as the OS can VM software can take advantage of it.\r\n\r\nI\'m also curious if this is one of the differences between the free and paid VMWare solutions / Microsoft Virtual PC / Parallels? I\'d love to see some reviews that really compare how efficient and flexible they each are.\r\n\r\n','Confused about 64-bit',0,'','publish','open','open','','confused-about-64-bit','','','2007-07-19 11:24:52','2007-07-19 18:24:52','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/19/confused-about-64-bit/',0,'post','',0),(254,2,'2007-07-19 11:36:09','2007-07-19 18:36:09','The other application I should mention is Media Center with several XBox 360s remoted. Each remote XBox creates a whole new login for Windows with another set of the the Media Center apps + most of the basic system stuff. With the XP 2005 version its only about an extra 100mb for this extra stuff and the base system (for me) is only about 900mb on a non-memory constrained system, so 2gb should be plenty. Of course so far my experience with Vista is that it needs about twice as much memory for everything and I don\'t see why this would be an exception- maybe its one of those better safe than sorry things to just get the 2x2gb memory instead of the 2x1gb ones since its only about twice as much ($210 vs about $100).\r\n\r\n','More About Memory and 32/64-bits',0,'','publish','open','open','','more-about-memory-and-3264-bits','','','2007-07-19 11:36:09','2007-07-19 18:36:09','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/19/more-about-memory-and-3264-bits/',0,'post','',0),(255,2,'2007-07-22 20:50:50','2007-07-23 03:50:50','<a href=\"http://www.tongfamily.com/dim_sum_in_seattle.php\">Rich writes about Dim Sum in Seattle</a>. Overall I\'ve found this one of the very frustrating parts of living in Seattle because I love Dim Sum and the overall quality doesn\'t seem nearly up to Vancouver or San Francisco. In general I find his observations to be good, although I\'d also recommend a new discovery- the appropriately named \"Dim Sum House\" on 4860 Beacon (not in the middle of any of the usual restaurant clusters). I haven\'t found any especially interesting or new Dim Sum here, but the stuff I\'ve had (I\'ve been 3 times in the last few weeks) has been fresh (order from the menu, no carts going around with stale stuff), and just simply good. Its no <a href=\"http://www.tastingmenu.com/archive/2003/11-november.htm#Tuesday,_November_4,_2003,_10:50_PM\">Hakkasan</a> but I can\'t head to London (or even Vancouver or San Francisco) every day for lunch.

They key findings are that both of the one step under the top cards are the best for media scenarios- the AMD Radeon 2600HD and the NVidia 8600GTS. Comparing the two head to head the NVidia card has better video quality, especially \"noise reduction\", although its unclear how much noise reduction you really want for any properly mastered HD content. The Radeon has better support for VC-1 decoding which is not supported in hardware n the NVidia card, but VC-1 (designed by Microsoft I think) is much less CPU intensive to decode in the first place- on a low-end P4 machine it was still only taking 30% CPU so the quad-core Q6600 I\'m planning on getting should handle even multiple simultaneous streams of it with no problem.\r\n\r\nThe missing review is still the stability one. For a media-box, running for weeks without crashing or needing a reboot and without hangs or missed recordings is a key criteria. Maybe I shouldn\'t be hoping for that driver stability review from the web-sites that tend to publish tons of over-clocking results, but its not like anyone else has really researched this yet either. I\'m pretty convinced that there will be some big differences between NVidia and AMD on this stuff...\r\n\r\n','Video Card Benchmarks for Media Scenarios',0,'','publish','open','open','','video-card-benchmarks-for-media-scenarios','','','2007-07-23 18:12:07','2007-07-24 01:12:07','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/23/video-card-benchmarks-for-media-scenarios/',0,'post','',0),(257,2,'2007-07-24 15:52:28','2007-07-24 22:52:28','I\'ve been playing with Sharpcast a bit the last few days and even signed up for their premium service. The key hook there is that they offer to \"backup\" full-resolution copies of your images on their servers. The current offer has no quota associated with it which makes the $6/month very attractive.  Uploading photos in one photo is really easy but it takes a bunch more work to upload a bunch of different folders. Still, as long as the unlimited photos thing holds out, it seems like a very nice service.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been playing with various ideas in this space and the Sharpcast guys have overall done a very good job. Nice client to web-site integration. Fairly good upload, although it will consume all available bandwidth if it can (be careful running it on a work network since you don\'t want to bring everyone\'s network to a grinding halt).\r\n\r\nAll the same there are some pretty key missing features. Its still early so I hope they will add these soon. I really miss being able to assign star-ratings to photos and to filter by the star ratings.

First of all it was really cool that this event was pulled together with such a heavy-hitting panel of journalists. A big thank you! to <a href=\"http://blog.redfin.com/\">the Redfin</a> and <a href=\"http://www.madrona.com\">Madrona Venture Group</a> folks for pulling this together and sponsoring it. It was a beautiful evening for an outside event and it was a great excuse to get together with a bunch of entrepreneurial folks to chat. I\'d also like to mention that I was impressed to see so much of the local VC community show up. It makes a difference when they are present and part of the discussion at events like this.\r\n\r\nI felt a little bit disappointed with the panel discussion but in retrospect its probably more about my expectations than the panel itself. With a title like \"Naked Truth\" and panelists like <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/\">Michael Arrington of Techcrunch</a>, <a href=\"http://www.fredvogelstein.com/\">Fred Vogelsten of Wired</a> (who was involved in the recent \"naked\" issue), and John Cook who writes for the Seattle PI business section and (to me) more importantly writes the <a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/\">John Cook Ventureblog</a>, I was expecting to dig a bit more into how the Internet as a communication medium has changed the relationship between the press and the industry. It felt like the panel mostly covered some great PR basics (and reading the announcement again thats all that was promised). All of it was really good stuff and it was great to hear this stuff from real journalists.\r\n\r\nOf course the great thing about \"the Internet as a communication medium which has changed the relationship between the press and the industry\" is that we can continue the conversation beyond the event itself and I can post my thoughts at more length on here. \r\n\r\nOne question from the audience was something along the lines of \"should you try to get your story told in the WSJ or just aim for the local press\". On one level the answer to that is fairly easy. If your story is newsworthy enough to make the WSJ, you would be a fool not to get that coverage. They have huge reach, and the credibility of being mentioned in the WSJ can be critical. That is pretty powerful.\r\n\r\nYet, let me make a counter argument. If you go to the <a href=\"http://thenakedtruth.wetpaint.com/\">\"Naked Truth\"</a> page, there is an interesting distinction between the 5 reporters. 4 of the 5 have their names linked to their blogs (ok, Fred\'s is a bit stale and Tricia shares a blog with 4 other reporters as far as I can tell). But Rebecca Buckman\'s link is to her name on Technorati. Follow it and you find lots of mentions of her (and for right now of this event) but nothing BY her.\r\n\r\nNow, the WSJ isn\'t completely an old-media dinosaur. They have a huge web-site and can proudly say that they are one of the few in the world that have managed to run a profitable content-subscription business on the web (it is rumored that the NY Times is about to give up on their Times Select subscription). But the subscription site puts all their stuff behind a closed door. How often will anyone ever link to it? It has power on its own since it comes with the strength built up over decades of the WSJ, but it doesn\'t exist as part of the web.\r\n\r\nCompare that to <a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/\">John Cook\'s blog</a>. Frankly, for a long time the business sections in local newspapers (IE- not the NY Times or WSJ) have been in a rough spot. Most business professionals read one (or both) of the two \"national\" papers, and it seemed like too often local business coverage was trending towards the equivalent of \"human interest\" pieces. Not that there is anything wrong about those, just they aren\'t going to be considered important.\r\n\r\nI found out about John Cook, not from his newspaper writing, but from his blog. Blogs of course have that interesting characteristics that they all link to each other, and I started seeing links to John\'s blog and pretty soon I subscribed to it. Because of the lightweight mechanism and frequent updates I\'m sure he gets to cover a bunch more than he would be able to write in the newspaper. For me, I get this much better picture of the scope of venture activity in the Seattle area. It puts him and the whole PI business section on the map, and that\'s the map that covers the whole Internet, not just Seattle.\r\n\r\nI don\'t mean to overstate the case and suggest that mention by John is more valuable for a company than a mention in the WSJ. Just that its not so clear cut anymore- the same thing that has put the power to publish in the hands of non-journalists also is a powerful tool for the pros. And its worth saying that I think there continues to be an important role for professional journalists- I\'m not at all in the camp that seems to be saying that somehow a bunch of random people typing away can do just as well as someone with real training and experience at finding out the real story.\r\n\r\nI\'d also point out that there is a business dilemma here. Professional journalists deserve to be paid for their work. Especially given blog readers which don\'t show your sites ads, its much harder to get paid for writing on a non-subscription blog. I\'m a proponent of the right to charge for software that has value and this content should be regarded in a similar way. Yet the right to charge for software isn\'t always the same as the practical ability to charge for software. As an entrepreneur you are faced with the unpleasant reality that pretty much any consumer facing web-site is going to have to be mostly free and you need to figure out how to monetize it some other way. The usual technique is to follow the lead of the 1st National Change Bank.\r\n\r\nThe other topic that was mentioned, but I would love to explore more is ethics. Arrington did mention this a bit, both in poking at the WSJ\'s potential massive conflicts if they get bought by Murdoch as expected and also being straight up about his goal of making a buck for himself. It feels like one of those situations where both the traditional journalists and the new-style ones are struggling with what is appropriate in this new medium. Bloggers run with different rules than the traditional journalists have, but I\'d have to assume that the professionals feel some pressure to adapt to compete for that hot story. At the same time they feel the pressure of the corporate consolidation of their industry and the pressures that inevitably flow to the editors.\r\n\r\nFinally I\'d like to mention a foundational question that doesn\'t get asked enough. Why does a start-up want to talk to the press? Getting lots of PR seems like a given for most people (\"there is no such thing as bad press\") but without thinking about your motivation a bit it is hard to focus to get the right kind of coverage that meets your goals.\r\n\r\nPress can give you two things- the first is distribution. In the old days distribution was cutting the deal with Egghead so your boxes showed up in every store and some people might buy them. Today getting mentioned to millions of people is more valuable since for many businesses they can reach you from any web-browser if only they have heard of you and have some reason to type the name of your site.\r\n\r\nThe second thing they give you is credibility. If someone randomly visits one of my sites, the chances are pretty high that they will head somewhere else without even a single click, and are overall fairly low that they will trust me enough to sign up for an account. On the other hand if Wired just wrote a glowing article about some great new service and someone is going to check it out, they are much more likely to check it out carefully and sign up for that account.\r\n\r\nTalking to the industry press is more about developing business contacts and financing than attracting customers to your site. Of course, these two points still apply.\r\n\r\n','Naked Truth Event',0,'','publish','open','open','','naked-truth-event','','','2007-07-24 23:59:00','2007-07-25 06:59:00','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/24/naked-truth-event/',0,'post','',0),(259,2,'2007-07-25 09:34:33','2007-07-25 16:34:33','<a href=\"http://blog.seattlepi.nwsource.com/venture/archives/118685.asp?source=rss\">John Cook did a very good write up of the meat of the panel discussion last night</a>.\r\n\r\nOne of the comments on his post points out that all the journalists said pretty much that the best way to get coverage was to provide one journalist a scoop. From my experience that is close, but its not the whole story.\r\n\r\nThe key isn\'t a scoop, its a unique story. Journalists don\'t exist to just write the same thing over and over repeating your message to the word (that\'s what bloggers do.. oops). If its a truly huge story (\"Microsoft announces next version of Windows\") everyone will print it, just in the off chance that their segment of the audience missed it everywhere else. But for most of us, its only going to work if the journalist feels that they have some special take on it.\r\n\r\nSo when you work with each journalist, think about what interesting thing you would like them to say. Keep in mind that in the book world, stories have conflict, and while not everything that gets printed in the press has conflict, it sure does make it more interesting. <a href=\"http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2007/07/what-people-tal.html\">Guy Kawasaki published a list of the nine best story lines for marketing from Lois Kelly</a>. This is a pretty good list, although it doesn\'t rank them by how easy of a story they are to spin- David vs. Goliath is one of the most obvious ones and it works for almost any company and is a pretty easy one to believe. Its a good way to get coverage, but its not necessarily the best way to keep the focus on you and the wonderful thing your company does for its customers. Still, its a good one to think about since it tends to come out even if you don\'t plan on it.\r\n\r\nOf course this all varies quite a bit by the publication. <a href=\"http://www.techcruch.com/\">TechCruch</a> tends to favor writing straight profiles of companies. Wired tends to focus on what Kelly calls the \"Avalanche About To Roll\" of technological/societal change stories (although they do have a good measure of the other types thrown in too). Other publications will focus more on the business aspects.\r\n\r\n','John Cook on the Naked Truth Event',0,'','publish','open','open','','john-cook-on-the-naked-truth-event','','','2007-07-25 09:34:33','2007-07-25 16:34:33','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/25/john-cook-on-the-naked-truth-event/',0,'post','',0),(260,2,'2007-07-26 15:07:21','2007-07-26 22:07:21','Wider availability of the new 1TB drives has had the hoped-for result lowering hard-drive prices across the board over the last month.

Too often the comic pages are the same old thing over and over but Bill Watterson knew when to quit while still at the top of his game.\r\n\r\nOne quick Amazon complaint. When you create an \"image only\" link (not like the one above) it generates the URL as a relative URL:\r\n&lt;img border=\"0\" src=\"21JWCVFEK2L._AA_SL160_.jpg\"&gt;\r\nOf course that is relative on your site so it is always busted until you figure out the correct base URL.

I\'ve got most of the parts now and am building the machine soon (still waiting on the case) although initially I\'m going to use it as a workstation machine rather than media-center.\r\n\r\nWhile figuring this out I thought it would be interesting to compare what I was purchasing to an equivalent Dell machine. For years I always built my own PCs (before that I bought Macs). Then I realized probably back in 1998 or 1999 that certain Dell configurations were such great deals that it never made sense to built it yourself, just buy the crazy discounted Dell and upgrade whatever parts you needed to.\r\n\r\nStarting a bit more than a year ago the Dell machines stopped being the same good deal. It pretty much can be traced to the introduction of the XPS line. The XPS were the \"high end\" machines, but never had good discounts. Initially the non-XPS machines could still be had at 40% off (some inflated price) but were available in configurations that either started out high-end or could be upgraded. For example one of my machines was initially a 2.4ghz P4 Dell that I upgraded to the 3.6ghz cpu later. Because Dell offered the same model with the 3.6ghz chip, I knew the upgrade was possible. Lately however Dell has gotten rid of anything remotely high end in any model line but the XPS so the choices haven\'t been as good if you want anything beyond basic performance.\r\n\r\nTo quickly review the specs on the machine I just bought\r\nCPU: Intel Q6600- 4x 2.4ghz 1033mhz bus. $290\r\nMotherboard: Asus P5K Deluxe. $220\r\nCase: Zalman HD-135 Media Case. ~$275\r\nPower Supply: Zalman Ultra-Quiet 500W $119\r\nMemory: 2GB (1GBx2) DDR2 800mhz PC6400 CAS4 ~$99\r\nVideo: Gigabyte GF 8600GTS Silentpipe3- $183\r\nTV Tuner: AverMedia MTVPEMCER- $104\r\nDVD Burner: Sony Optiarc 18X DVD+R 8X SATA- $33\r\nHard Drive: Seagate 750GB $199.\r\nTotal is $1522 for a fully functional system.\r\nAdd Windows Vista Premium for $115 for a total of $1637.\r\n\r\nSo today I went shopping on the Dell site. Things had improved quite a bit since the last time I checked- go figure that the pricing changes are a bit harder to anticipate there, but they do show up. There was some strange CPU pricing still- the dual-core 2.66ghz CPU was $100 more than a quad-core 2.4ghz CPU, but I think they just hadn\'t fixed things up since the Intel price cuts.\r\n\r\nI first tried to compare to the Dell XPS 210. Since my machine will be in a medium-low profile case, this was the most equivalent case that they provided. The bad news is there was no way to get a XPS 210 to an equivalent configuration. They didn\'t offer any quad-core CPUs for it (for no particular reason), only offered a 500gb drive maximum and only have crappy video choices. The total still worked out to $1728.\r\n\r\nThe XPS 410 was a much closer comparison. I managed to spec one out that was just about equivalent. Same CPU, same GPU, same hard-drive. The only deficiencies in the Dell were that the TV Tuner card is less powerful, the power supply is only 375 watts (which is probably fine) and there is one less PCIex1 slot. That configuration worked out to only $1499 which is a pretty good deal- compare it to $1522 or $1637 depending on whether you want to include the price of Windows (which the Dell does include).\r\n\r\nThe plus side for the Dell is that it includes support. Of course at this price its only the 1-year basic support. Up that to the 3-year premium support and even with the discounts that adds the price is still $1698.\r\n\r\nThe down-side is that the Dell case is really poor compared to the one I\'m getting. Almost $400 of my price is going to the case and power supply, with the goal of a low noise, low-profile (135mm high so it can fit in my cabinet which is only 170mm clearance), high quality case. The Dell cases are OK, but they are nothing special and in any case the XPS 410 is 18.75cm wide so it would not fit where I want it. Its pretty easy to get a decent home-built case for $99 (there are some with power-supplies for as little as $19.99 on NewEgg). \r\n\r\nIn the end the prices are both in the same ballpark and the trade-off is flexibility vs. having someone else to deal with the problems that might happen. Now, Dell support for laptops has been great, but I\'m not so sure how well it would work out if I had a problem with a desktop. Mostly desktop machines are reliable enough that its safe to put aside $200 and if something breaks, you just order a new one. None of the parts except the CPU are much more than $200 and if that broke there are likely going to be better ones available for $200. For me the hassle of following up on a warranty / RMA return is rarely worth the cost of the item so its easier to just buy another one.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up another point- one of the nice aspects of going the home-built route is that you can pretty much get premium parts all around. Thanks to Dell keeping up the price pressure, its possible to stick with the good reputation name brands and the results can be pretty good- these guys tend to keep their drivers up to date and the failure rates tend to be low. With the Dell you don\'t know who is actually making all the bits and pieces, and Dell has to update the drivers which often creates a big lag. Its usually not a big problem since anything causing big reliability problems will get addressed (if its generating support calls for Dell).\r\n\r\nNext step- I\'ll report some results from my build.\r\n\r\n','Dell vs. Build It Yourself (part 1)',0,'','publish','open','open','','dell-vs-build-it-yourself-part-1','','\nhttp://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/18/hardware-updates-why-companies-avoid-pre-announcing-new-products/','2007-07-30 22:50:07','2007-07-31 05:50:07','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/07/30/dell-vs-build-it-yourself-part-1/',0,'post','',0),(264,2,'2007-08-01 11:23:53','2007-08-01 18:23:53','<a href=\"http://www.rp0229.com/blog/2007/07/31/impressions-from-seattle-facebook-developer-garage/\">Rahul has a good write up about the Facebook developer garage last night</a>. First of all I\'d like to thank the hosts- both the local Seattle guys and the Facebook team that flew up for the event. They sent a bunch of people which is a pretty big statement about how seriously they are taking this platform stuff.\r\n\r\nA couple of my own observations about the recent Facebook stuff, especially in relation to their platform aspirations-\r\n\r\nThe big draw here is that Facebook is becoming the magic way that you sprinkle \"viral\" on anything. Up to now just about every startup I have worked with has spent lots of time trying to figure out how to build some viral mechanisms into their products. No one wants to go spend millions on saturation advertising campaigns (not that those necessarily work so well anymore anyway) so the premise of building some cool small feature and having exponential userbase growth to millions of users in just a week or two sounds great.\r\n\r\nOf course building those features and managing the community and social aspects of pulling it off can be very hard (ok, building the feature is easy, its the other part that is hard). By use Facebook\'s existing community and viral mechanisms, in theory it should be much easier to latch into their 33M and growing userbase with your app. You still need to build a compelling app and think through why people want to share it, but probably half the work is already done for you (including some of the hard part).\r\n\r\nAt the same time, Facebook does have a few problems to deal with. First of all the definition of \"compelling app\" has been a bit loose initially. There are a number of very simple apps that have had great success getting millions of users to sign up with them in a short time, but its hard to see how those are going to stand the test of time and generate any meaningful revenue. On the other hand <a href=\"http://www.ilike.com\">iLike</a> is probably the definition right now of what it means to be a compelling app, bringing a bunch of rich information to the picture and tapping into some deep needs that are especially social.\r\n\r\nPeyman pointed out to me that one of the big things they are missing is revenue share. My initial reply was that with 2000 developers signing up in 2-3 months, who needs to bother with revenue share? The size of the potential audience is large enough that people will gladly build apps without getting revenue directly from Facebook.\r\n\r\nBut what this is missing is the issue of alignment of interests. Right now listening to some of the people building Facebook apps, it sounds like most of them are just trying to grab Facebook users and channel them into their own things. There was lots of frustration with Facebook limiting amount of notification, but its pretty clear to me why they do that- right now people would spam the heck out of the users if they could. In any case, a rev-share scheme would align developer\'s interests with those of Facebook. It worked pretty well for Google AdSense, and although it is not directly the same thing, they could make this work for them.\r\n\r\nEarly on the host asked who was working on this stuff for their day job. It was striking to me that almost no one raised their hands. Maybe those who are working on this full-time either didn\'t have time to show up for this event or were just keeping their hands down. This is not to slight the potential of some of those nights and weekend projects to hit it big, but it also shows how early all this stuff is.\r\n\r\nFinally it feels like Facebook is dealing with some real identity / culture issues. They grew up as a college oriented network, but unlike MySpace have focused on keeping things clean and less obnoxious. Yet, many of the developers there said that the audience seems like mostly high-school students, and many of the apps are cutesy in a way that is likely to turn off audiences older than 25. They have a real opportunity right now to catch a broader audience of the country, but at the same time there is a big danger of a backlash if the older audience doesn\'t feel like spending time on Facebook means being overrun by high-school kids and content that is tuned for them.\r\n\r\n','Facebook Developer Garage in Seattle',0,'','publish','open','open','','facebook-developer-garage-in-seattle','','','2007-08-01 11:23:53','2007-08-01 18:23:53','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/01/facebook-developer-garage-in-seattle/',0,'post','',0),(265,2,'2007-08-01 16:16:47','2007-08-01 23:16:47','One of the most useful unix commands is tail and its been too bad that this isn\'t built into Windows.

Mostly it is going pretty well, but there are a couple of little issues I\'ve been struggling with. I\'ve noticed via email and comments that some of my posts about technical problems I\'ve faced and solutions have been the most popular, so I\'m going to try to keep up a good flow of these.\r\n\r\nTheir documentation doesn\'t really have step-by-step explanations of what happens over the wire yet. I think all the details are there somewhere, but it took reading the PHP sources to fix some issue with the app I was building in .NET. The big issue is that the example sources showed doing a redirect when a user is first connecting to your app and hasn\'t authenticated yet. However if the user is accessing you in the \"canvas\" (IE- inside Facebook), a normal HTTP redirect is NOT the right thing  to do. Instead you need to return the FBML for a redirect-\r\n\r\nResponse.Write(\"&lt;fb:redirect url=\'http://www.facebook.com/login.php?api_key=\" + AppAPIKey + @\"&amp;v=1.0\'/&gt;\");\r\n\r\nAnother issue I hit is that it feels like I really need two accounts to test my application and its interaction with other users. I have not gotten notifications to work yet. The catch with this is there is a checkbox that hides your application from people other than yourself while you are developing it (\'developer mode\'). But while that checkbox is checked, my second account can\'t access the app. So this is a bit of a catch-22.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I\'ve noticed is that Facebook won\'t let me be signed in from more than one computer at a time. I typically am using 2-4 computers at once and really appreciate that most of the Google sites, GTalk, and others let me be signed in all over and they just work. Its a real pain when testing stuff that whenever I use a different computer to access Facebook it makes me sign in again.\r\n\r\n','Developing for Facebook- small problems',0,'','publish','open','open','','developing-for-facebook-small-problems','','','2007-08-02 10:34:04','2007-08-02 17:34:04','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/02/developing-for-facebook-small-problems/',0,'post','',3),(269,2,'2007-08-02 15:56:17','2007-08-02 22:56:17','From the biking trails at Whistler.\r\n\r\n<img id=\"image270\" src=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/08/whistler-trial-sign-cropped-small.jpg\" alt=\"Whistler Trail Sign- Yield to Bears\" />','Good Advice',0,'','publish','open','open','','good-advice','','','2007-08-02 15:56:17','2007-08-02 22:56:17','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/02/good-advice/',0,'post','',0),(270,2,'2007-08-02 15:54:56','2007-08-02 22:54:56','Sign from the biking trails at Whistler BC.

I got some step by step pictures. One thing I can mention write away is that the case is a lot deeper than I was really thinking. It is close to square- 17.5\" wide, 16.5\" deep. For my applications this should be fine (the place I want to put it has plenty of room behind), and it makes it fairly easy to lay things out since the drives do not overlap the motherboard at all. Its also a little thicker than I was thinking. While they advertise that its 135mm thick (HD135), its actually closer to 160mm, because it has little stands and the power-supply has a cut-out so it goes lower than the rest of the case. This is actually a good thing- I was a bit concerned when I unpacked the power-supply and thought it might not fit. As long as you have 160mm of space + a little extra room for exhaust, its a nice design.\r\n\r\n','CPUs',0,'','publish','open','open','','cpus','','','2007-08-06 11:00:54','2007-08-06 18:00:54','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/06/cpus/',0,'post','',0),(272,2,'2007-08-06 12:07:48','2007-08-06 19:07:48','<a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2171603/nav/tap3/\">Slate has an article about how the airlines are seeing record profits while service is at an all-time low</a>. I\'d just like to add a few notes to the article.\r\n\r\nThe article points out that customers can blame others for their misery- the FAA, the TSA, and the weather. Except as far as I can tell the FAA air-traffic system is overall working really well. The airlines try to hype how much of a problem it is, but that is mostly because its their favorite excuse and they hope to make a grab to get other users of the airspace (small airplanes, other carriers) out of their way. As for the weather, it can sometimes be an issue when there are actual big storms, but its not the sort of thing that a well-run airline couldn\'t accomodate for. Plus, I\'ve caught airlines lying numerous times about either FAA traffic issues or weather as an excuse for late flights. If you are a pilot its not that hard to hear the gate agent blame one of those two for a delay, go sit down in your seat with a laptop and a wireless connection, and check for actual flow-control notices and/or weather issues. So far my experience is that about 50% of the time its a straight-out lie. I\'m not saying that the gate agent knows that its a lie, but someone at the airline is spreading false information to pass the blame.\r\n\r\nBut the article\'s main point is true- most people believe this stuff, so the airlines manage to dodge the blame for their mismanagement.\r\n\r\nOf course to call it mismanagement in the technical sense would imply that its poor business for the company involved. The amazing thing with the screwed up situation with this industry is that the companies have managed to position themselves so that not only do they make big profits while treating the public like crap, but we also subsidize them to the tune of billions of dollars to do it. I guess when you put it that way, maybe it should be written up as a nice Harvard Business School Case Study \"how to treat your customers like crap and make billions\".\r\n\r\nMy favorite example is what I realized <a href=\"http://www.aa.com\" title=\"American Airlines has the worst customer service ever\">American Airlines</a> is doing with overbooking in my little incident with them. The article points up that the load factor (filled seats) has risen from 66% to 78% over the past decade. Handled correctly this is a good thing for everyone because it results in a more efficient economic system. The catch is that there are supposed to be protections in the system against the airlines pushing it too hard in their favor.\r\n\r\nIf they overbook an airplane and have to bump you, they owe you some money. So if they do it too much, they start to lose money. Except that American has realized that by causing passengers to miss their connections, even when its 100% the airlines fault, they get out of the bump fees. Everyone misses the flight they were booked on and winds up on the next flight, but with no rights to any compensation. The airline gets all the money from filling every seat in every flight, working their bizarre pricing schemes to maximize the pennies they wring out of every passenger. \r\n\r\nAnd THAT is I guess what you would call good management.

One is using 250mb drives for 1.25gb capacity and the other is using 400gb drives for 2gb capacity.

Can I upgrade the drive size by just pulling the drives one at a time, replacing each with a bigger drive, waiting for it to rebuild until everything is balanced again?\r\n\r\nOr is it much safer to copy everything somewhere else? This sounds like a pain since its 1TB, but then again with drive sizes now getting 1tb of free space somewhere else isn\'t as hard as it used to be, just a bit slow.\r\n\r\n','Upgrading a RAID Array',0,'','publish','open','open','','upgrading-a-raid-array','','','2007-08-10 10:05:56','2007-08-10 17:05:56','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/10/upgrading-a-raid-array/',0,'post','',5),(275,2,'2007-08-10 13:19:50','2007-08-10 20:19:50','<a href=\"http://ignitenight.blip.tv/file/199588/\">I finally discovered my talk on Maximizing Performance in Aircraft Engines</a> available for your viewing pleasure on the web.\r\n\r\nI\'d forgotten how embarrassing it is watching a video of yourself...

Most of the parts that I\'m considering have not really hit the market yet or are so new that the pricing is still astronomical. Also it looks like they aren\'t hitting 3.33ghz on the high end, only 3.13ghz for a whopping $1200. At those prices its going to be really tempting to take a step back to the 3ghz model or further. [Correction- this data is for the Xeon server processors, not the desktop ones I would be using]/\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I\'m also hoping to get a motherboard with the high end P38 chipset (not available yet anywhere that I have seen although it was announced months ago) and ideally DD3 RAM which is currently priced so high as to be unrealistic. Stay tuned to see if I hold out for the P38 and fast RAM or just bail and get another Asus P5K with lots of cheap DD2 RAM. Given that I like to play with multiple server boxes running in VMs, it seems like an easy bet to go for more RAM (4GB or more) over faster RAM which in benchmarks I\'ve seen is only good for a 2-5% boost, although with the quad-core CPU with a 1333mhz front-side bus, its quite possible that DDR2 800mhz RAM would really hold it back.\r\n\r\nRough equipment list-\r\n\r\nCPU: Intel Penryn 4x 3ghz 1333mhz bus. $850\r\nMotherboard: Asus P5K Deluxe P38 equivalent. $275\r\nCase: Zalman HD-135 Media Case. ~$275 ??? Undecided. Another HD-135 actually seems like a reasonable idea. I can keep the computer in my rack totally away from my desk.\r\nPower Supply: Zalman Ultra-Quiet 500W $119 Works well in the other machine, although I\'m considering a 600W given the faster CPU and higher end video card.\r\nMemory: 4GB (2GBx2) DDR3 1333mhz PC6400 CAS4 (currently $750 for 4x1gb, no way I\'m going to pay that much)\r\nVideo: ??? GF 8800GTS 640MB or ATI HD2900XT 512MB $400\r\nDVD Burner: Sony Optiarc 18X DVD+R 8X SATA- $33\r\nHard Drive: Seagate 750GB $199 x 2.\r\n\r\nTotal right now is $3100 although I\'m hoping to get it well down under $3000 before I start buying the pieces. I can trace back to 1987, the high end computers I\'ve bought have always been $3000-$4000, and while there have been amazing breakthroughs in the cost of lower-end systems, the industry still does a good job extracting at least $3000 from people who want more power. I could probably drop 20% performance and get it down to about $2200 which is worth considering\r\n\r\nStep down from the top system-\r\nCPU: Intel Penryn 4x 2.66ghz 1333mhz bus. ~$500\r\nMotherboard: Asus P5K Deluxe. $220\r\nCheaper case: $200\r\nPower Supply: Zalman Ultra-Quiet 500W $119 Works well in the other machine, although I\'m considering a 600W given the faster CPU and higher end video card.\r\nMemory: 4GB (2GBx2) DDR2 800mhz $400\r\nVideo: ???

I\'ve always found it to be a nice mix of news, eclectic interesting articles and opinion.\r\n\r\nLately they seem to be trying to chase the latest hot Internet trends by offering many of their articles as video under the brand \"Slate V\". To me this effort falls totally flat. The type of mental place I\'m in when I check in on Slate is not somewhere where I want to be having to listen to the audio and move along at the pace that they set. Now, I understand catering to different audiences, so if this is just a supplement to the existing content, fine. I also understand that sometimes pictures, video, or audio really are important to communicating the story. They have long had slide-shows (and video slide shows) for pieces where that fits. But it feels like many of the Slate V pieces are not available as normal text and would have been much better suited to sticking with that medium. \r\n\r\n','Slate V',0,'','publish','open','open','','slate-v','','','2007-08-14 11:14:37','2007-08-14 18:14:37','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/14/slate-v/',0,'post','',1),(280,2,'2007-08-17 09:49:12','2007-08-17 16:49:12','There have been a couple of posts lately about VC funding and how much money you should take. The frequent advice from all sides (not just the VC guys) is to not get too hung up on what percentage of the company you end up with- get enough money to make the company successful, give enough equity to the other major players in the company to make the company successful.\r\n\r\nThis is all true as far as it goes, but it glosses over the key distinction between the non-VC funded company where the founders are keeping close to 100% vs. the situation once you accept funding. When you take that step, you are greatly increasing the size of the bet you are making. It is easy to think of it as \"this should be a safer business play since I have money in the bank to fund whatever I need to do to be successful\". But at the same time you have changed the level of the acceptable outcomes. As a 3 or 4 person founder-bootstrapped company, you can all be very happy making $1-2M revenue or selling out for $5M. There are tons of business ideas that fit in this space that represent perfectly reasonable \"base hits\". But generally with that bigger investment you are now in a mode of swinging for the fences, needing to target $100M+ in value to make it all work out.\r\n\r\nNow, there are also lots of businesses that fit this model, but I suspect there are a lot more of those base-hit opportunities than the home-run ones. In baseball, the big home run hitters tend to not have the highest batting averages...\r\n\r\nPlease don\'t misinterpret this post as to suggest that I\'m down on VC. Its just that many new entrepreneurs I speak with at meet-ups seem to assume that it is the only model and/or don\'t take the time to think about whether it is the right fit for their specific business idea and/or life goals. It is also worth noting that some segments of the VC industry are adapting and figuring out ways to make smaller investments make sense, creating incubators, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Owning 100% of zero is worth as much as 10% of zero',0,'','publish','open','open','','owning-100-of-zero-is-worth-as-much-as-10-of-zero','','','2007-08-17 09:49:12','2007-08-17 16:49:12','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/17/owning-100-of-zero-is-worth-as-much-as-10-of-zero/',0,'post','',0),(281,2,'2007-08-21 11:30:17','2007-08-21 18:30:17','Years ago I registered to vote by absentee ballot all the time.

Which brings up a better question- why do you have to pay postage to vote anyway? Voting is our most basic government function and as mail-in voting becomes more commonplace, doesn\'t the postage become a form of (very small) poll tax?\r\n\r\nSo let\'s get our elections commissions to solve this problem- either via pre-paid postage envelopes or better yet a national postal service rule that ballots don\'t require postage (much like congress gets to send free mail).\r\n\r\n','Mail in Votes',0,'','publish','open','open','','mail-in-votes','','','2007-08-21 11:30:17','2007-08-21 18:30:17','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/08/21/mail-in-votes/',0,'post','',0),(282,2,'2007-08-21 11:38:56','2007-08-21 18:38:56','<a href=\"http://www.tafiti.com/\">Tafiti has just gone online</a>- it is a new web search experience by Microsoft and <a href=\"http://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/2007/08/21/a-new-search-experience/\">Jackson Fish</a> with a lot of the development work done by <a href=\"http://www.launch21.com/our-team/\">my Launch21 partner Peyman Oreizy</a>.\r\n\r\nThere are two immediate things that strike me as cool about Tafiti- first of all, its built in Silverlight and is a great showcase for how the Silverlight platform can enable much richer web experiences than we have seen before.\r\n\r\nThe second aspect is as a different angle on vertical search.

It was on the way towards almost making sense not getting cable or messing with DVR and just getting the individual TV shows you want a-la-carte. With Unbox, iTunes, and the XBox video service you just download the shows you want, pay for each show, and enjoy.\r\n\r\nDone right this should be a huge win for the TV networks. It seems like the only downside for them is that they lose the advantage of their wide distribution, but that is going to happen whether they play or not. The only stumbling block to make it more widespread is cost. At $2 for most TV shows whether they are 20 min (cut out the ads) or 40 minutes, high definition or not, its just not quite a no-brainer to watch everything online. If the Daily Show and Colbert Report were more like $1 per show and even better you could get a cheaper subscription I\'d be there. But at $2 per show, that is 20nights/month X $4/night = $80/month. Sounds like the studios are being greedy. Here they have this opportunity to make some really solid revenue streams from their shows and get off the falling interruption advertising market.\r\n\r\nAnd then <a href=\"http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/08/nbc-universal-d.html\">the news today is that NBC is pulling out of iTunes because they want to charge $5 per show</a>. Wacky and clueless. NBC was slow to put many of their shows on Amazon Unbox, but I see that <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FLaw-amp-Order%2Fdp%2FB000V5RS4A%3Fpf%5Frd%5Fm%3DATVPDKIKX0DER%26pf%5Frd%5Fs%3Dcenter-5%26pf%5Frd%5Fr%3D0KS2V991K7AEJ110M23R%26pf%5Frd%5Ft%3D101%26pf%5Frd%5Fp%3D304560801%26pf%5Frd%5Fi%3D46053011&tag=lancairtalk-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325\">Law and Order is up there now</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lancairtalk-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />.\r\n\r\nHopefully they won\'t jack it up to $5. Like I said, and $2 per HD episode, they have a great thing going and probably have ~$40/season extra revenue from me, especially if they do a better job posting the episodes right around when they go live.

Maybe if they do a directors cut of that movie they can add the copyright guy into the back-room along with the smoking, alcohol and gun lobbies.\r\n\r\nCopyright is indeed an important thing for our society and as someone who creates intellectual property for a living I rely on it quite a bit. But the take that Patrick Ross takes in his piece deliberately misstates the origin and concept behind copyright (and patents for that matter). Both were created intended as a balanced sets of rights and responsibilities between producers of creative and innovative works and industry. With both copyrights and patents the idea was that the creator would be given exclusive rights to their creation <em>for a limited period of time</em> in exchange for making it publically available and adding it to the body of human knowledge. This was always explicitly balanced by the notion of fair use that these copyrights and patents could not be used abusively.\r\n\r\nNow forward in the current era, greedy folks are making land-grabs to increase the value of their intellectual property and lobbyists like this guy are trying to confuse the public about their fair use rights. Copyrights were supposed to expire after the death of the creator, but various entertainment interests (especially Disney) keep pushing Congress to extend their copyrights almost indefinitely. Meanwhile the copyright lobby keeps trying to diminish your traditional rights to purchase a piece of creative work and use it as you would like and protect it with backups by layering on DRM, the DMCA, and hostile legal threats at the beginning of videos and TV programs. Not content to sell you a song for a buck or two, they want to charge you an extra $1-2 for a 30-second excerpt of that thing you already own, but used as a ringtone. They want you to have to buy new copies of all your media every few years as there are new technological shifts and as the CD/DVD media you own wear out.\r\n\r\nLets be clear. There are vibrant and creative entertainment industries and despite the fear-mongering by the copyright lobby, they are not going away. Sure, they are going to have to shift and adapt with new times and new technologies. Some industries that have made money in the past as middle-men might be going away (for example the big record companies and tv networks) as these new technologies reduces the need for their role (and creates new middle-men like Google, Amazon, Apple). But just because a given big record company isnâ€™t healthy does not imply that musicians are somehow going to go away.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I\'m fairly annoyed with news.com for running this propaganda piece without enough context and wanted to call it what it is.\r\n\r\n','Thank You For Smoking',0,'','publish','open','open','','thank-you-for-smoking','','','2007-09-06 12:51:41','2007-09-06 19:51:41','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/09/06/thank-you-for-smoking/',0,'post','',0),(293,2,'2007-09-07 10:10:56','2007-09-07 17:10:56','<a href=\"http://www.avweb.com/news/ceocockpit/ceo_of_the_cockpit_73_those_devilish_little_airplanes_195936-1.html\">Kevin Garrison writes a good article on AvWeb about Aviation delays and debunking the myth the airlines have put forth that small aircraft are the cause</a>. This from the perspective of someone flying one of the big jets for a major airline.\r\n\r\nTwo things are worth noting. The first and most important is that the pilots for the big airlines are not the guys at fault in this situation and are usually sympathetic to fighting the con job their management are trying to pull off. These guys have been the biggest victim of the management incompetence of the major airlines as they have tried to deal with the shifts in their wacky business models. Their work conditions get worse, they get screwed out of their pensions, and meanwhile they feel like they are being encouraged to lie to their customers.\r\n\r\nThe second is that he points out the real cause of these traffic screw ups- the major airlines for some reason tend to schedule just about every airplane they are flying to take off and leave at the same time.\r\n\r\nNow, it may make the schedules look clean at your major hub to have every arrival at 3pm and every departure at 4pm. I bet its even easier on the scheduling software. But its not going to actually work. Unless of course your aim is to intentionally make sure passengers miss their connections so you can avoid having the pay the bump-fees. Hmmm...\r\n\r\nSo just a reminder. Next time you are out on a taxiway in a line of 20 airplanes waiting to take off. Its not the little-guy holding you up. Its unlikely that we are taking off from the same runway and when we do, we tend to slip in between the jet departures (since we can often take off quickly and turn out of the departure path to get out of the way). Anytime there are 20 jets stacked up other than some major issue with the runway, its a clear sign that the folks running the airline you are flying couldn\'t figure out how to coordinate schedules to spread things out a bit in a more sensible way. For organizations responsible for billion dollar machines flying through the air, this stuff should be pretty basic.\r\n\r\n','Aviation Delays',0,'','publish','open','open','','aviation-delays','','','2007-09-07 10:10:56','2007-09-07 17:10:56','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/09/07/aviation-delays/',0,'post','',0),(294,2,'2007-09-11 09:54:36','2007-09-11 16:54:36','I\'ve been rethinking what video card to put in the new workstation that I\'m going to build this fall. Since this machine will also be something that I want good high-end 3d on (for high end WPF work, games, Flight Simulator, etc) I want a step up from the NVidia 8600GTS that I put in the media center box (which I\'m using as a workstation in the short term).\r\n\r\nMy initial thought was to go with the NVidia 8800GTS (640MB version). Many of the reviews say the 320MB version is just fine and the extra memory is unnecessary, but I run on a Dell 30\" monitor at 2560x1600 pixels so I\'m going to opt for the extra memory.\r\n\r\nThe 640MB NVidia cards run about $360, but at right about the same benchmark scores and price (about $380) is the top of the line AMD (ATI) Radeon HD 2900XT. Most of the write ups score the two cards just about equal head-to-head.\r\n\r\nBut the balance might tip to the Radeon because the Intel chip-sets (the current P35, and the X38 that I hope to get) only support the AMD \"Crossfire\" dual-card option and don\'t work with NVidia \"SLI\". Its pretty ironic that the Intel chips are likely going to tip me towards an AMD video card, but there you have it. I\'m not planning on buying two cards right away, but it gives me the option to get a second one a year down the road (although by that time there will probably be a new generation of cards and I\'d be better off just replacing it with a single new card).\r\n\r\n','Video Cards for New Workstation- AMD (ATI) HD 2900XT vs. NVidia 8800GTS',0,'','publish','open','open','','video-cards-for-new-workstation-amd-ati-hd-2900xt-vs-nvidia-8800gts','','','2007-09-11 09:54:36','2007-09-11 16:54:36','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/09/11/video-cards-for-new-workstation-amd-ati-hd-2900xt-vs-nvidia-8800gts/',0,'post','',0),(295,2,'2007-09-11 22:30:48','2007-09-12 05:30:48','It seems like Facebook has been getting slow lately.

I wish they provided a \"staging\" server. The idea is that you can develop your app there, test it there, and any platform changes they do get rolled out at the staging server for at least a week before the move them to production (except of course for any fixes to exploits). This at least would give developers a fighting change of staying on top of this stuff.\r\n\r\nThe other big issue this brings up is the perception of the cause of the problem. I\'ll give the Facebook folks some credit for using fairly neutral language in their text, but the implication is still that the problem is with the app developer. <a href=\"http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/09/12/facebook-apps-are-pointless-if-they-dont-work/\">TechCrunch just ran a piece on Facebook apps and how many of them are failing to scale</a>. Of course, the catch is that while many of these apps might be done by some non-professional folks on a shared hosting server that can\'t handle the load, that is not necessarily the real story.\r\n\r\nMy app is running on a dedicated machine in a datacenter. The machine is a fairly high performance dual-core machine that is typically running at less than 5% usage. My uptime as recorded by various tools has been 99.86% for the past 8 months (with pretty much 99.99% for the past 3-4 months). I can hit my site directly and I never get a failed request. Yet when accessing my Facebook apps on the same machine I see the same error messages that TechCrunch is attributing to poorly designed unscalable apps.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of possible explinations. It could be a bug in the code of my app where it hangs somehow. Unlikely, but its possible. It could be a complex interaction in Facebook calling my server and then my server making callbacks to Facebook to server the request. But in any case something is turning out to be less than commercial-quality reliability and it doesn\'t feel like its in my control.\r\n\r\nMakes you think twice about exposing your brand to these kind of issues.

Now people argue about DSL vs. Cable and they have lots of good arguments one way or another. I\'ll grant that an Internet connection from the cable company would probably be much cheaper for comparable speeds.

They make it easy to get static IP addresses, and I\'ve always had great service experiences with them. I\'ve had a handful of outages in 10 years and only once or twice were the outages more than brief.

This is a good example of the power of Silverlight (since it really enables you to use markup for stuff in your normal HTML page way). But its also unfortunately the kind of thing that isn\'t going to be adopted much until Silverlight gets deployed more widely. I suspect no one wants to force people to do a download just for somewhat better visuals.\r\n\r\nWhich brings up an interesting feature suggestion (which might already be there). If Sistr made it really easy to fall back to the standard HTML rendering (or a PNG file) when Silverlight is not installed rather than pushing the Silverlight install, this could be easier to adopt. Since it supports the same HTML markup already, that should be fairly straightforward, although the rendering can be so different that designers might not like that approach.\r\n\r\nOr another approach would be a web-service that creates the PNG server-side for users that don\'t have Silverlight. Cache it so you don\'t re-render on every request, but make the developer story just as easy as putting markup in a page (as easy as the existing Sistr).\r\n\r\n','Font Rendering Using Silverlight',0,'','publish','open','open','','font-rendering-using-silverlight','','\nhttp://fortes.com/2007/09/17/introducing-sistr/','2007-09-17 20:27:36','2007-09-18 03:27:36','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/09/17/font-rendering-using-silverlight/',0,'post','',1),(300,2,'2007-09-17 22:52:44','2007-09-18 05:52:44','I bought an extra 2GB for the \"media center\" box that I\'m using as a workstation at the moment.

There is this great opportunity for up and coming airlines that emulate these guys to take over and provide a great, efficient air travel system for our country. The main thing holding this back is the lobbying efforts of the old guys. The old guys grew up under the old system of regulated air travel and while they adapted once the industry was deregulated, they never figured out how to escape the trap of their old business models that were based on charging 10x fares to last minute and business travelers compared to everyone else. They also appear to be stuck in a fundamentally hostile management/labor relationship and the combination results in the bizarre poor service that we all see.\r\n\r\nThere was a thing on the radio yesterday about a movement to create a passengers bill of rights. This appears to be driven by people who are focused on the incidents where they have been trapped in airplanes sitting on the ground for 5+ hours. My feedback would be that there are some good ideas in this movement, but they are missing the bigger picture. Passing new rules that protect passenger rights is putting a band-aid on the gushing wound. What we need to do instead is to stop subsidizing the old-style airlines and let the bad ones fail. In the mean time we need to provide good customer information on how the airlines are doing and try to remove some of the restrictions that are holding them back. I understand Southwest still deals with some bizarre rules about flights into and out of Texas, and if you look at the pain that Virgin America went through to get permission to fly in the US, its just a shame. Another great move would be to pursue a more consistent energy policy that helps the airlines have more predictable fuel prices. One of the cornerstones of Southwest\'s strong business performance over the past decade is that they did a great job of locking in fuel prices before they went swinging all over. In theory the government could be helping provide this kind of stability for the whole industry and even making it available to new entrants in the market.\r\n\r\n','Great Airline Service',0,'','publish','open','open','','great-airline-service','','\nhttp://www.naffziger.net/blog/2007/09/17/incredible-airline-customer-service/','2007-09-18 08:22:09','2007-09-18 15:22:09','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/09/18/great-airline-service/',0,'post','',1),(302,2,'2007-09-18 15:02:48','2007-09-18 22:02:48','Another stupid mistake I just made.

My assumption is that I\'m going to hold out for DDR3 memory which should add about 10-20% to system performance once you get the faster DDR3 parts.

First, Speakeasy is doing an impressive thing where every day they send me an email with the current status of my order. This email has a set of checked off steps, but it also have the complete details of every communication between Speakeasy (ISP), Covad (DSL line provider), and Qwest (line infrastructure). Its an interesting way to approach the issue of having three vendors that don\'t always see eye to eye. Speakeasy is still the main touch point with the customer, so even if they can\'t always control their vendors, they can at least provide full visibility of what is going on. I\'m impressed.\r\n\r\nAlso, they emailed me today to double check on the install date to make sure that I\'ll be home. It turns out I need to take care of some aircraft maintenance that day so I asked to reschedule. They said that the next install date was 2 weeks out, but hey, can you do this Friday?

The news looks pretty disappointing. Most of the new boards are DDR2 since DDR3 memory is just too expensive to buy. And compared head to head against a P35 chipset board they offer no performance advantages today. All things being equal if things don\'t change in a major way I\'ll just buy another Asus P5K for my workstation and equip it with 4GB of relatively inexpensive high-speed (1066mhz) DDR2 memory. That stuff costs about $270 for 4gb right now so all things considered its very affordable.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of advantages that the X38 is supposed to have, but none of them are really useful yet at least for me. The X38 has better support for over-clocking but I don\'t really care about that. Its supposed to have slightly better support for DDR3 memory but the P35 supports DDR3 also and as mentioned its starting to look like it doesn\'t matter since DDR3 is just not realistic in the short term.\r\n\r\nThe other big advantages are that it supports two full x16 PCI-e channels whereas the P35 supports one at x16, and one at x4. So if you do dual video on a P35 the second one is somewhat bandwidth limited, although I haven\'t seen any reviews that really show how big that impact is. I\'m not planning on buying a second video card in the short run anyway. Also the x16 PCI-e channels support PCI-e 2.0. But no video cards do yet. Any idea when PCI-e 2.0 cards are coming out? With this winter\'s refresh or much later?\r\n\r\nIn any case its starting to look like its going to make sense to just stick with the P35. Considering that the x38 boards cost at least $100 more right now worst case I can upgrade the motherboard next year once it matters. Although to be realistic, by that time its usually not worth upgrading the motherboard without upgrading all the other components too...\r\n\r\n','X38 Chipset Reviews',0,'','publish','open','open','','x38-chipset-reviews','','','2007-09-26 10:37:28','2007-09-26 17:37:28','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/09/26/x38-chipset-reviews/',0,'post','',0),(310,2,'2007-09-26 14:27:25','2007-09-26 21:27:25','<a href=\"http://www.engadget.com/2007/09/26/researchers-tout-advances-in-development-of-pure-white-leds/\">Engadge has a piece on progress in the technology of white LEDs</a>.

The specifics around how they are releasing it are going to eclipse the album itself...\r\n\r\nSo this weekend <a href=\"http://www.inrainbows.com/Store/Quickindex.html\">they announced the new album In Rainbows</a>. And in an unprecidented move its available in 10 days, not 4 months. Because you don\'t have to wait for it to be pressed onto CDs and for the big marketing rollout. Its a download.\r\n\r\nNot only that, but you get to set the price that you think is fair for it. I\'d kill to see statistics on what people choose to pay. Heck, given how screwed mosts artists get by their labels, I bet Radiohead could get more cash selling the market research than the typical band gets for the album (not that this would be consistent with their style).\r\n\r\nApparently after the last album their contract with their label expired and they just decided to not renew. So far it seems like the new approach is going well for them- their blog says that the site has been experiencing difficulties from extreme load.\r\n\r\nFor what its worth I\'ll share what I decided to pay for it. 3.99 pounds. Which comes out to a bit more than $8 US, or about the same price as downloading any of their other albums from Amazon. Except of course this way the band presumably gets most of the money, no middlemen.\r\n\r\nSo, a big round of applause for Radiohead, and if anyone still thinks the music industry in 5 years is going to look remotely like what it used to look  like 5 years ago, I\'ve got a quality bridge to sell you in New York...\r\n\r\n','New Radiohead Album- In Rainbows',0,'','publish','open','open','','new-radiohead-album-in-rainbows','','','2007-10-01 20:52:14','2007-10-02 03:52:14','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/10/01/new-radiohead-album-in-rainbows/',0,'post','',0),(313,2,'2007-10-03 12:53:34','2007-10-03 19:53:34','<a href=\"http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2007/10/03/releasing-the-source-code-for-the-net-framework-libraries.aspx\">Microsoft is releasing the sources for the .NET frameworks</a> including most of the base libraries, XML, and even stuff like WPF.

The download went flawlessly, all the concerns about Radiohead being able to deal with the infrastructure seemed unfounded. To be honest, it went more smoothly than my Amazon mp3 download experience since Radiohead just sent out customized links and didn\'t try to do some wacky \"you can only download once and you are screwed if the download fails\" sort of thing. Its amazing how people can just make things more complicated for themselves (and their customers!) in unnecessary ways... I wonder if Amazon should try to block TCP-level retransmits to make sure you receive each packet only once?\r\n\r\nTwo things that could have been better- I wish the files were encoded at more than 160kbps. Its better than 128kbps but I\'d rather see 256-320kbps to get much closer to lossless quality. I would have expected that with the band managing the process they would have cared about making sure their \"product\" was at the best quality possible, but then again most people won\'t notice or care and I suppose it does preserve some value for people who buy the physical CD.\r\n\r\nI also wish they had included some album-art files. Its nice to have them in Explorer / the Media Library and too bad they didn\'t just include a few of the correctly named JPG files.\r\n\r\nThe music? Its almost beside the point right?

The good news is that it looks like we are going to see some huge increases of memory bandwidth from the typical 800mhz today to 2000mhz soon (the over-clocking potential of some of the new memory is a good sign of what typical memory will do in 2 to 3 years).\r\n\r\nThe bad news is that as typical for high performance computing, the impact on overall system performance is still small. Computational/memory intensive benchmarks are showing a 2-3% improvement going from DDR2-800mhz to DDR3-1333mhz (which is the \"normal\" DDR3 speed now) and maybe 5% improvement from DDR2-800mhz to an over-clocked DDR3-2000mhz. I\'m sure it would be different with a 5ghz processor or more likely if you are running 8-cores instead of the 2-cores they used for testing. This is one of those typical situations where performance improvements to one component only have a small impact unless that specific component is really holding back the rest of the system. Try comparing a 3ghz quad-core CPU with 400mhz memory vs 800mhz memory if you want to see a much more direct relationship between the memory speed and overall system performance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, DDR3 memory is still psycho expensive on the range of $400 for 1gbx2, vs around $70 for the same 2gb in high quality DDR2-800 or maybe $130 if you want to get DDR2-1066 sticks (although the enthusiast sites suggest that most DDR2-800 chips run at DDR2-1066 easily).\r\n\r\nThe catch is you have to bet on a memory technology when you buy the motherboard and presumably within a year (and maybe much sooner) DDR3 will become mainstream and much more reasonable. Still considering that I\'m interested in at least 4gb for my workstation, there is no way I\'m paying an extra $700 for RAM. Also there is no such thing as 2gb DDR3 DIMMs so if I want 2gb on each stick (for future expansion room) I need to go with DDR2 anyway. 4gb (2x2gb) DDR2-800 is only about $160, or for $190 I can go for DDR2-1000. Since the newer Asus boards all officially support 1066mhz memory speeds that seems like a pretty safe bet to squeeze a little extra performance out for only a few extra $.\r\n\r\nThe <a href=\"http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=9180\">other news out recently is that ATI should be shipping a new generation video board based on a die-shrink soon</a>. The interesting aspect of this news for me is that they might have a new board out based on the RV670 that will have lower power consumption and only take up one slot for the cooler, not blocking the slots next to the video card, yet it will still have similar performance to the current top of the line Radeon HD 2900s. Of course on my workstation I don\'t really have anything I was planning in putting in any of the other slots, but its nice to have the extra flexibility.\r\n\r\n','DDR3 Memory Update',0,'','publish','open','open','','ddr3-memory-update','','','2007-10-12 10:50:36','2007-10-12 17:50:36','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/10/12/ddr3-memory-update/',0,'post','',0),(316,2,'2007-10-13 18:08:12','2007-10-14 01:08:12','Dana wrote a <a href=\"http://www.tastingmenu.com/2007/10/11/perfecting-panna-cotta/\">great piece on Perfecting Panna Cotta</a> over on Tastingmenu.com.

I do this all the time- use FlightAware and other services to tell when your incoming flight is actually arriving. Also as a pilot I have access to aviation weather and flow control information and I\'ve often checked up on them when the airlines claim a flight is delayed due to ATC flow-control or weather. I\'m estimate is that for the major airlines like American, United and Northwest, about half the time they claim delays due to ATC or weather its a lie. Which is not to say that the gate agents are telling a lie themselves- they may not know, but someone at the airline is. More often than not the cause is bone-headed airlines that have scheduled 50 of their own flights to take off or land at the same moment at one of their hubs, which is just inexcusably bad management.\r\n\r\nAn interesting contrast in airlines is our trip out to Minnesota two weeks ago. Outbound we flew Northwest. I just missed taking a photo of the gate sign showing our \"departure time\" as 10 minutes in the past. The flight was late (ok, it happens, no big deal) but they never bothered to try to keep people informed or update the displays anywhere.\r\n\r\nOur return flight was on Sun Country, one of the newer-style airlines. The contrast was amazing- the return flight was also late. But they made announcements every 10-15 minutes keeping us updated on the status, they frequently updated the board with a projected (and fairly realistic) new boarding and departure time, and even suggested that people call ahead if they having someone picking them up to warn about the potential delay. It was the model of good customer contact through proactive honest communication.\r\n\r\nI just don\'t believe that its that hard for an airline to keep passengers and gate crews informed of what is really going on- heck, I was in Bend Oregon the other day being picked up by a friend in a small Columbia aircraft and could track his arrival with better precision than Northwest or the other guys would ever communicate to their customers. Travel can be complicated and stressful and if these big airlines would spend 10% of what they spend creating ads showing the beautiful travel experiences, on actually giving a better experience, people might not hate them so much. Instead they are just lazy and take the short cut of telling deliberate lies to try to placate their captive audience. Lets be clear- if it were not for government subsidies, the old guys would have already been out of business by now in a classic case of good capitalist \"creative destruction\" and there would be more room for the new guys like Sun Country, JetBlue and Southwest to replace them with good service.\r\n\r\n','Outsmarting Your Airline and Sun Country',0,'','publish','open','open','','outsmarting-your-airline-and-sun-country','','','2007-10-14 15:43:51','2007-10-14 22:43:51','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/10/14/outsmarting-your-airline-and-sun-country/',0,'post','',0),(318,2,'2007-10-17 13:21:33','2007-10-17 20:21:33','Fun, I think I just got my first push poll.

Now before I go on I should say that us Internet types are supposed to pooh-pooh these kind of analysis as \"old school\" and \"not understanding how the Internet changes things\".\r\n\r\nSo I\'ll get right on it. Don\'t want to disappoint after all.\r\nt\r\nMy reading of this article is that all its analysis is in terms of traditional models. It asks the classic economic questions \"does one product (the online version) act as a replacement for another product (the print version)\". And it looks at pricing/revenue models in terms of subscription vs. advertising. It suggests the big thing that has changed is that advertising on the Internet is becoming more mature and thus there is real money in it.\r\n\r\nOf course the article totally ignores the ways in which the Internet is not like other media. Their analysis might be appropriate for comparing newspapers to TV news (with TV having free + advertising vs. subscription, not that anyone was crazy enough to try to charge for the subscription beyond the inclusion in the basic cable package).\r\n\r\nWhat\'s missing about the analysis of the Internet sites is a discussion of the effects of linking and search engines, and those don\'t really have a comparison outside this new medium. By keeping lots of their content locked up inside a subscription site the NY Times and Wall Street Journal have by and large kept their content out-of-play from the rest of the Internet.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at any Internet property, you consider three types of non-paid traffic sources- direct, referral, and search. Sure, there are some web-sites that people will regularly go to on a frequent basis just by typing their address into their browser, and relatively speaking a daily newspaper is a good candidate for this since their most important content has a low shelf-life and thus if you are prominent enough you will get a fair amount of direct traffic. But even among daily news a large amount of traffic can be from blogs, link blogs, news aggregation (like Google News), and search. These publications actually do tons of articles (food reviews, recipes, movie info, and more) that would be great targets for organic search and could generate substantial long term advertising revenue if they were available.\r\n\r\nThe NY Times had the worst of these worlds. Much of their daily content was available for free, but after a week or two it would get locked away. So they didn\'t get the ability to really monetize that old stuff and people would be reluctant to link to their news since the links would go dead after a bit.\r\n\r\nHopefully with the recent changes these publications will actually join the web (the world of interconnected sites) and I\'m expecting with the huge value of their content they will be able to make some great bucks off that.\r\n\r\n','Slate on Paying for Online Newspapers',0,'','publish','open','open','','slate-on-paying-for-online-newspapers','','','2007-10-27 14:37:49','2007-10-27 21:37:49','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/10/27/slate-on-paying-for-online-newspapers/',0,'post','',0),(320,2,'2007-10-27 18:22:05','2007-10-28 01:22:05','One big problem that technology hasn\'t solved at all.

First of all an update on an older item. <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/28/update-on-nvidia-geforce-8600gts/\">I bought the Gigabyte SilentPipe GF 8600GTS for the Media box</a> a few months ago. I guess its not the end of the world since I did need something until now, but it turns out to have been a mistake. The Zalman HD135 case supports full height cards, but just barely. There is no room over the top of the connector but the heat sink on the SilentPipe card goes above the top and the top of the case doesn\'t fit (although its very close).\r\n\r\nAlso this is hardly a totally silent case anyway- with the thing buttoned up I had some heat problems so I probably need better cooling on the video card and/or another fan anyway.\r\n\r\nI\'d been thinking about maybe picking up one of the AMD (ATI) Radeon HD2600 cards. They have great media benchmarks and I\'m not really planning on using this machine for 3d. But today along comes details of the NVidia 8800GT which should be faster than the existing $399 8800GTS, and available for just about $200. Its built with a better process (65nm) so its lower power, and there are 1-slot versions so it won\'t block the slot next to it. Hopefully even a normal fan-cooled version of these won\'t be too loud, and I\'m probably going to want the same thing in my workstation too (since it blows away everything in the AMD line for gaming and only the $600 card is any better and that isn\'t by much).\r\n\r\nOf course this card (especially at $200) makes the motherboard choice even more painful since using NVidia SLI starts to sound reasonable. But the Intel P35, X38 and X48 chipsets don\'t support SLI, so you are left with some pretty painful choices.\r\n\r\nOn the processor front, it does appear that Intel is going to have an upgrade to the 3.0ghz 1333mhz bus Penryn chip in Q1 2008. The upgrade should be 3.2ghz with a 1600mhz bus. The clock is only 7% faster, but its one of those things where if you combined it with the faster bus AND fast DDR3 memory the whole thing might be good for a 20% improvement. But even with DDR3 prices coming down, they are still likely to be 2x DD2 in 3-4 months and its hard to imagine that you don\'t end up paying $600 extra for that 20% improvement.\r\n\r\nI wonder when NVidia is going to come out with a new chipset? Their 680SLI is feeling a bit old compared to the new Intel ones and given that they have a video-card coming out with PCI 2.0 I\'d expect them to do a chipset to go with it.\r\n\r\n','Hardware Updates- NVidia 8800GT, Penryn Updates and more',0,'','publish','open','open','','hardware-updates-nvidia-8800gt-penryn-updates-and-more','','\nhttp://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/06/28/update-on-nvidia-geforce-8600gts/','2007-10-29 13:26:55','2007-10-29 20:26:55','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/10/29/hardware-updates-nvidia-8800gt-penryn-updates-and-more/',0,'post','',0),(323,2,'2007-10-29 13:36:50','2007-10-29 20:36:50','Of course it looks like I jumped the gun a bit in some of my conclusions in my previous post about video cards.

Of course from my discussions with Chris they have all kinds of cool ideas coming that go way beyond the kind of ways you can interact with a band at an in-person event.

Meanwhile the new Radeon 3xxxx series is due tomorrow so it seems like it might be a busy couple of weeks to watch the new announcements and pick our parts for a system.\r\n\r\nDDR3 RAM continues to drop its price rapidly- looks like $239 for the 1333mhz 2x1gb kits.

But the most egregious abuse is that most of these apps are more focused on spamming invitations rather than providing useful features.\r\n\r\nWhy do half the actions not provide any useful information in the news feed, instead making me click on it? Because then they make my add their stupid application, and invite other people just to see what someone actually did. Facebook authors are more busy being viral than providing useful service which is a bad trajectory.\r\n\r\nTo be fair, its not a new thing. Evite is a example of the worst of this. When you receive Evite messages they typically don\'t have the useful information in the email, like when and where the invitation is for. They are stuck in a business model where they are so focused on driving traffic to their web site and to their ads that they annoy you to death.\r\n\r\nMy buddies at <a href=\"http://www.jacksonfish.com/\">Jackson Fish Market</a> have introduced <a href=\"http://www.invitastic.com\">Invitatistc</a> which takes this problem head on. Its simple, doesn\'t do wacky stuff, but its useful and doesn\'t have to beat you over the head. I\'m hoping they are right with their bet and that people will realize that you want to use a service more if it focuses on adding value rather than scamming you. I\'m assuming Facebook apps will realize this too- I just noticed several things in my feed that were more useful- for example in the past it always said \"John Doe has asked a question\" and now it appears to be including the question in the news feed which is a big improvement.\r\n\r\n','Invitastic and Facebook Evil',0,'','publish','open','open','','invitastic-and-facebook-evil','','','2007-11-14 17:04:48','2007-11-15 00:04:48','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/11/14/invitastic-and-facebook-evil/',0,'post','',0),(330,2,'2007-11-15 19:11:02','2007-11-16 02:11:02','I got Guitar Hero a week ago and I have to admit that its very addictive.

The hardware part is all done I think so its time to start some observations while I get all my software installed and setup.\r\n\r\nBefore I go onto details of the build and some comments on the parts, I\'ll mention that I did manage to overclock it to 4.0ghz (quad core), which I think is pretty cool. I suspect I\'ll bring it back to 3.66ghz or so in a bit to run a little cooler since that extra little bit doesn\'t actually matter, but as a milestone it was pretty fun ti hit. If I think about it, I had my first 3ghz machine probably 4 or 5 years ago and I think I got a 3.6ghz machine 3 years ago just about this time of year. Of course that was the old slower P4 architecture and only single-core (although HyperThreaded), so this machine is probably well over 4x the performance of those machines.\r\n\r\n<h3>The Antec P182 Case</h3>\r\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=lancairtalk-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B000P0CTSQ&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\nOverall I\'m very disappointed with the Antec P182 case that I got. Before I get into the details lets say that this is a big case. It has 6+ 3.5\" drive bays, 4 5.25\" drive bays, and is supposed to have plenty of room for everything. Overall the situation for PC cases is just pitiful. Compared to the Mac Pro they all are pretty bad. You get the gamer-cases that are all dressed up with wacky windows and plastic demon skulls. And you get other cases that various people tried to design but pretty much none of them are done with any skill or taste.\r\n\r\nThis case is for my new main workstation. This is going to be a high performance computer and I\'m starting with 4 hard-drives although only a couple of PCI cards (video and sound). The case needs to provide for clean cabling, good cooling, not be super-loud (but my office already has enough fans that it doesn\'t need to be silent or anything) and I\'d like it to look decent.\r\n\r\nSo to recap, I\'m looking for-<ul><li>Plenty of space</li>\r\n<li>Easy expandability</li>\r\n<li>Looks decent</li>\r\n<li>Good cooling</li>\r\n<li>Not loud</li>\r\n\r\n<img src=\'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-empty.jpg\' title=\'Antec P182 Case Empty\' />\r\nEmpty Antec P182 case before install\r\n\r\n<img src=\'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-power-supply-jam.jpg\' title=\'Antec P182 with Power Supply Installed\' align=\'left\'>\r\nThe parts for the computer came in a few at a time, so I started putting things together before everything arrived. The power-supply goes in the bottom of the P182. Pretty quickly I\'m hitting trouble as its a real pain to jam the thing in there. Even worse, there is a nice fan in the bottom in between the bottom drive-bay and the power-supply, but its getting in the way of the cables coming out of the power supply. Later on I end up having to take this fan out because the situation is even worse on the drive side, with the drive cables (power and SATA) are impossible to get out of jamming the fan. The picture to the left is before I removed the fan and you can see how tight it is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAgain, let me point out that this is a very big case. Not the biggest, but its the biggest I have. In a SFF system you can excuse a certain amount of jamming things in. In a large tower case the designers are supposed to have figured this stuff out so that things can be put together without creating a problem.\r\n\r\n<img src=\'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-drive-cram.jpg\' title=\'Antec P182 Drive Bay\' align=\'left\'>This may be a situation where the case designers have not caught up yet with modern parts. I suspect it might work with old IDE style drives but the SATA connectors stick straight out more and need more room behind the drive bay. To be clear, with the Antec P182 its hard to not bend your SATA power connectors to the point where they break. This picture shows the drive bay with out the fan- the metal bar at the top of the picture is where the fan would be and you can see how much the power cables would be bent if it were still there.\r\n\r\nAnother issue (which points to a similar blind spot) is that all the fans have old-IDE style power connectors rather than headers which attach to the motherboard. These are bigger and mean that your motherboard can\'t monitor and control the fan speed. The case has some nice external switches that let you adjust fan speed, but the ideal situation is to have the motherboard automatically adjust it based on the internal temperatures so it can crank up when you are gaming and run quiet the rest of the time.\r\n\r\nThe fit for the motherboard itself is also fairly tight, again given the size of the overall case. There are some baffles that let you separate out the bottom power-supply/drive section from the main section, but they get in the way of the bottom of the motherboard (where Asus puts the USB/Firewire and front-panel connectors).\r\n\r\n<img src=\'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-power-cable-routing.jpg\' src=\'Antec P182 Power Cable Routing\' align=\'left\' >\r\nFinally, if you get this motherboard you need to make sure that your power-supply has a long enough 12V cable. Normal cases put the power-supply at the top of the case which will end up being close to where the 12V connector is on the motherboard, so the power-supplies tend to not make this cable long enough. The P182 does make a nice provision to run the main power-connectors behind the motherboard to keep them out of the way of the expansion cards, cooling, but my 12V cable was at least 4\" too short and so I couldn\'t actually get things working inside the case until I bought an extension. You can see the extension cable in the bottom right of the picture. This part from Amazon is exactly what you need to fix this situation-\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=lancairtalk-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B000M802RG&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n<img src=\'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-dvd-rails.jpg\' title=\'Antec P182 Case DVD Rails\' align=\'left\' />\r\nThe last thing that was a trouble during install was that I couldn\'t figure out how to mount my DVD drive in the external bays. I was probably just being stupid but the manual is (as usual) horrible at providing any useful information on this stuff. It was not clear whether you insert the drive from the inside or the outside, other than that the inside is blocked by the motherboard. My first attempt to insert it from the outside got stuck because I put the mounting rails on backwards- it turns out that the clips go towards the outside of the case which (to me) is non-obvious.<br/>\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, some observations on the case now that it is all put together. Overall once it is put together it seems very nice. The big thing I\'d look for differently is that it is a pain having the DVD drive inside a fold-out door. To insert/remove disks you need to open the door and put it in. I\'d much rather just have external access to the drive so the front-door thing ends up being a pain overall.\r\n\r\n\r\n','New Workstation- Part 1 Antec P182 Case',0,'','publish','open','open','','new-workstation-part-1-antec-p182-case','','','2007-12-17 12:25:26','2007-12-17 19:25:26','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/12/17/new-workstation-part-1-antec-p182-case/',0,'post','',10),(337,2,'2007-12-17 12:05:22','2007-12-17 19:05:22','Antec P182 with Power Supply Installed showing limited room for cables','Antec P182 with Power Supply Installed',0,'','inherit','open','open','','antec-p182-with-power-supply-installed','','','2007-12-17 12:05:22','2007-12-17 19:05:22','',336,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-power-supply-jam.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(338,2,'2007-12-17 12:05:44','2007-12-17 19:05:44','Antec P182 Power Cable Routing behind the motherboard','Antec P182 Power Cable Routing',0,'','inherit','open','open','','antec-p182-power-cable-routing','','','2007-12-17 12:05:44','2007-12-17 19:05:44','',336,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-power-cable-routing.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(339,2,'2007-12-17 12:06:12','2007-12-17 19:06:12','Antec P182 Case before install','Antec P182 Case Empty',0,'','inherit','open','open','','antec-p182-case-empty','','','2007-12-17 12:06:12','2007-12-17 19:06:12','',336,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-empty.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(340,2,'2007-12-17 12:06:38','2007-12-17 19:06:38','Antec P182 Case DVD install showing correct rail direction','Antec P182 Case DVD Rails',0,'','inherit','open','open','','antec-p182-case-dvd-rails','','','2007-12-17 12:06:38','2007-12-17 19:06:38','',336,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-dvd-rails.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(341,2,'2007-12-17 12:06:56','2007-12-17 19:06:56','Antec P182 Drive bay showing limited space for cables','Antec P182 Drive Bay',0,'','inherit','open','open','','antec-p182-drive-bay','','','2007-12-17 12:06:56','2007-12-17 19:06:56','',336,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/antec-p182-drive-cram.jpg',0,'attachment','image/jpeg',0),(342,2,'2007-12-18 10:02:16','2007-12-18 17:02:16','I\'ve been using VMWare workstation to run some virtual machines lately. Its very helpful to be able to have a WinXP IE6 box, WinXP IE7, Vista, Linux, etc, all at once, not to mention other nice uses of VMWare.\r\n\r\nSo yesterday I\'m doing some big file copies and noticing that my network transfer performance on my gigabit Ethernet is running a solid 6%. Not a blip over or under, as if something were hard-limiting it. I also notice there are these two extra network adapters that VMWare has installed which each think they are 100mbps connections.\r\n\r\nSo I try disabling them (since with a little poking around I find out they are only necessary if you are doing on-machine NAT or internal networks) and like magic my network transfers hop up to 9.5%. These get installed by default but for most people you will never need them, so get rid of them.\r\n\r\nNow to figure out what the next bottleneck is. The machines involved have plenty of CPU, I was testing on multiple disks so disk IO should not have been limiting, and I\'m pretty sure everything is hooked up with nice high quality cables on my gigabit switch.\r\n\r\n','VMWare and Network Performance',0,'','publish','open','open','','vmware-and-network-performance','','','2007-12-18 10:02:16','2007-12-18 17:02:16','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/12/18/vmware-and-network-performance/',0,'post','',2),(343,2,'2007-12-18 09:58:58','2007-12-18 16:58:58','For some reason when I install Windows components on my new workstation there is an app called TrustedInstaller.exe that runs incredibly slow.

I wonder if using DVR starts you down that slope? First you are just time-shifting shows to later that night, then you watch them a different day of the week when you have more time. Pretty soon you are catching up on weeks of episodes. 24 season 5 and the first season of Prison Break were the first big cases where we saved up the whole season- it can be fun to watch them all in a row in just a few weeks.\r\n\r\nAmazon Unbox has made this much easier since I don\'t have to record and save up from the TV broadcasts. I just caught up on the new Battlestar Galactic series and I\'ve got to say I\'m impressed by both how good the show was as well as how good the experience can be watching this stuff in high quality on Amazon. I\'ve been hoping to catch up on Lost also but unfortunately Unbox does not have it (despite having many other CBS programs).

In theory its all handled by the Intel chipset, should be high performance. As RAID1 writes aren\'t any faster, but reads should be twice as fast, so running Windows, my page file, and other key stuff on there should help give me great performance. Plus I figured my time is very valuable, and not having to worry about rebuilding my whole machine if I have a drive failure sounds like a great idea, right?\r\n\r\nIt was a TERRIBLE IDEA. It was terrible. A complete mistake.\r\n\r\nThe catch is that for your boot drive, RAID1 makes it way less reliable. Partly because its controlled by all these BIOS settings, and I\'ve had times when it reset and then the machine started up with the drives not in RAID mode. Which was fine until I tried to put it back into RAID mode. Then it wouldn\'t boot and I couldn\'t get the Windows repair utilities to touch it. Faced with the possibility of having to reinstall Windows I switched RAID mode off and now I just have a normal system disk.\r\n\r\nThe other thing I didn\'t realize is that as a RAID disk, if anything happens to the system like a crash or whatnot, it is going to have to rebuild it. Of course rebuilding the disk when you are trying to boot from it is a bad thing, and as far as I can tell the controller can\'t really do a rebuild until the system is done rebooting.\r\n\r\nPlus it needs special drivers that aren\'t built into Vista (or most other operating systems) so anytime you are trying to install/do system maintenance you are back to installing these extra drivers, which is just a mess.\r\n\r\nSo the RAID is gone. I\'ll probably just use the 2nd disk for my page file and maybe move my VM data over there...\r\n\r\n','RAID for a Boot Disk',0,'','publish','open','open','','raid-for-a-boot-disk','','','2007-12-21 16:01:50','2007-12-21 23:01:50','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/12/21/raid-for-a-boot-disk/',0,'post','',1),(346,2,'2007-12-21 16:36:30','2007-12-21 23:36:30','','Error message',0,'','inherit','open','open','','error-message','','','2007-12-21 16:36:30','2007-12-21 23:36:30','',347,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/errormsg.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(347,2,'2007-12-21 16:36:56','2007-12-21 23:36:56','I\'m getting this error message a bunch when copying fairly large (~1gb) media files over the network in between two Vista computers.

As I\'ve mentioned before this is a new machine I built in a nice Zalman HTPC case, a quad-core 2.4ghz process (Q6600), the Gigabyte Silentpipe 8600GTS video card and an AverMedia dual-tuner card. The parts all follow my usual theory when building my own PCs- stick with the top quality name brand stuff.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been running the machine for a couple of months now as a workstation and its been running great. So I reinstalled Vista, installed the minimum of stuff I needed for its new role as a TV, unplugged the old media PC and plugged it in. The old Media PC is not getting touched until its clear that the new one is really working 100%. Part of what is so tough about penetrating this market is that you really rely on your TV. It sucks to reboot a PC ever, but rebooting your TV in the middle of a program sucks even more. And having your TV fail recording the football game right before the big ending is even worse.\r\n\r\nSo far the results are so-so. Overall the new user interface is nice, with two big flaws. The new 3-row UI for finding programs is a disappointment. I remember seeing this a long time ago when it was in development and thinking about how cool it looked. In particular it should be a much better use of the screen on wide-screen displays (like I have). It does look cool, but I find it fairly clumsy for finding things. Its even worse when for my video collections it shows the thumbnails for everything so finding an item with a given name is really hard. I think we figured out how to switch to a \"list\" interface, but its only somewhat better.\r\n\r\nThe other big issue is the video libraries. It now integrates with the Windows Media Player notion of libraries and scans directories for videos, pictures and music. The old one just let you browse directories to find the videos you wanted. Now, the new approach should be better but so far its not working very well so I go to my video directories and see nothing.\r\n\r\nAs for reliability, so far no general system crashes. But it has mysteriously failed to record a few programs in the middle of the night. Since I\'ve got the cable plugged directly into the tuner there are now cable boxes to screw things up now, so something is clearly failing in the box. So far its been old Star Trek episodes so no big deal, but it would be really annoying if we started missing the new episode of something (once there are new episodes of something back on TV at all).\r\n\r\nBut I\'ve had three incidents now that were even worse. In the middle of recording a program it has screwed something up in the file that causes playback to freak out skipping in a crazy way playing sounds like nails on chalkboard. It actually can corrupt it so badly that it caused the whole machine to lockup at 100% CPU for like an hour. It is not just the Media Center playback, playing the recorded file on another machine in Media Player does the same thing. I\'ve never seen something so screwed up.\r\n\r\nI do wonder if the bug is in the drivers for the video tuner card (since in theory lots of the encoding happens in hardware) or in Vista itself. I am tempted to try my older Hauppauge tuner to see if it makes a difference, although of course I don\'t have a consistent repro case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Media Center on Vista part 1',0,'','publish','open','open','','media-center-on-vista-part-1','','','2007-12-27 12:28:18','2007-12-27 19:28:18','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2007/12/27/media-center-on-vista-part-1/',0,'post','',0),(349,2,'2008-01-10 10:07:23','2008-01-10 17:07:23','Rock Band was the big arrival in our house this Christmas eve and its now been enough time to share some real thoughts on it.\r\n\r\nOverall Rock Band is way better than Guitar Hero III. Lots of small things are better- more customization of the look of your avatar, more variety of songs. The big thing is that it moves things into a very social arena. Given the addition of voice, Rock Band has the potential to become the new karaoke, but rather than just signing along with your friends, you can do the guitar, drums or bass parts along with someone singing. The New Years after most folks had left a couple of friends stayed and we had great fun messing around with various songs.\r\n\r\nThey have also done a great job with the downloadable songs. Every Tuesday since their launch there have been 3 to 5 more songs, and they have done a decent balance of classics and newer stuff. There have been so many downloads that this already shows up some really big weaknesses in the XBox Live marketplace- it is becoming a real pain to browse through them, the description box is so small you need to wait for it to scroll to really see what the song is, and they don\'t have the ability to do audio previews in the marketplace. Still, this is in serious danger of costing me $100-$250 a year if they can keep it up, and in an industry seeking ways to generate real revenue for music and artists, that should be gold.\r\n\r\nThere are two places where Guitar Hero III is still better. First, the overall feel of the guitar playing seems slightly better there- maybe its just that I got used to Guitar Hero first, but I feel like I get more places where Rock Band is just showing me missing notes for no reason. Also (go figure) the \"solo play\" for Guitar Hero is somewhat better, with the cool \"boss battle\" sequences, while the Rock Band solo play is just a list of songs.\r\n\r\nEarly production of the Rock Band guitar controllers apparently had lots of issues with the strum bar. Mine broke after just a few days but the EA return policy could not have been better. I just went to an online site, gave them a credit card # (just for a deposit) and they sent me a replacement in two days. I put the old one in the box and sent it back to them. No cost to me, very low hassle. Stuff breaks, but EA should be commended for having such a great approach to fixing it, and especially for letting me deal with it all on the web without having to talk to a support person.\r\n\r\nRock Band has the potential to be really huge. Its a bit expensive to get into it ($170), but the potential to be the karaoke \"party game\" replacement is huge, both in terms of being really fun and in terms of their potential market for the download songs. My advice would be to make sure they keep this scenario in mind as they produce new downloadable songs and game updates- make sure there are good modes in the game where its all about fun performing together, fun stuff to sing along with, etc. It would be great if they could do an update where you could have two microphones so people can sing along together, a better marketplace, better ways to browse the list of songs you own, etc.\r\n\r\n<iframe src=\"http://rcm.amazon.com/e/cm?t=lancairtalk-20&o=1&p=8&l=as1&asins=B000TT4GBG&fc1=000000&IS2=1&lt1=_blank&lc1=0000FF&bc1=000000&bg1=FFFFFF&f=ifr\" style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" scrolling=\"no\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" frameborder=\"0\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n','RockBand Thoughts',0,'','publish','open','open','','rockband-thoughts','','','2008-01-10 10:07:23','2008-01-10 17:07:23','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/01/10/rockband-thoughts/',0,'post','',0),(350,2,'2008-01-10 10:21:10','2008-01-10 17:21:10','Complaining about the mass media doing a poor job is like shooting fish in a barrel. Mostly I leave it to A Daily Show and the Colbert Report. But this one I\'ve got to comment on.\r\n\r\nI\'m really annoyed by all the coverage of New Hampshire. To read the headlines it would seem like Hillary Clinton had a huge defeat of Barack Obama. She did \"win\", but by 2 percentage points. But, and this is a big one, both Iowa and New Hampshire are not winner take all states- you get delegates proportional to your votes. So Obama\'s \"big win\" in Iowa gave him 16 delegates to Clinton\'s 15. And in New Hampshire, they each got 9. In other words, in the real impact, its a tie.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to hear the pundits talk about it, Mitt Romney is just sucking wind, with two second place finishes. Again, until you look at the delegate count and see that he is leading with 24, compared to Huckabee in 2nd place with 18. It is just AMAZING that no one in the press has mentioned this (that I\'ve seen, but granted I have very little patience for the inane commentary on TV, so my sources are the NY Times, Slate, etc).\r\n\r\nFurthermore I continue to be annoyed with the way that the press and politicians are barely covering the big scandal, which is how Iowa and New Hampshire continue to use thuggish tactics to maintain their up front primary and caucus roles, disenfranchising 99% of the US population from much of the election process. These two states are a very poor representation of America. They are both more than 95% white, to the extent that they have any minorities, they don\'t represent the Hispanic and Asian immigrants who are becoming very much a part of America, and even more important to me, they don\'t have ANY major cities (the closest either comes are the parts of New Hampshire that are effectively Boston suburbs and those are pretty far out there). Some of the key political issues are involving the differences between urban and rural issues and to let two states with no major cities have this kind of role is crazy for a society where more and more of the population is living in those big cities.\r\n\r\nI\'ll save complaining about the caucus system (typical voter turnout- 1-3%), for another post.\r\n\r\nBut the bottom line is that the major politicians and the party infrastructure both kiss these states butts, and it really has to stop. The extreme here is the way the Democrats have pretty much banned their candidates from campaigning in Michigan or Florida. Are they crazy??? Florida, hmmm, that really sounds like a good state to piss off the electorate.\r\n\r\nThere are several good proposals of rotating regional primary days that can give fair opportunities to various regions of the country and keep things so that candidates don\'t have to criss-cross the country constantly. Maybe now that Iowa and New Hampshire are behind us we can have some leaders with the guts to proclaim 2008 the last election where these guys go first.\r\n\r\n','Annoying Media (Election Coverage)',0,'','publish','open','open','','annoying-media-election-coverage','','','2008-01-10 10:21:10','2008-01-10 17:21:10','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/01/10/annoying-media-election-coverage/',0,'post','',0),(351,2,'2008-01-21 20:50:32','2008-01-22 03:50:32','The <a href=\"http://www.coachella.com/\">Coachella Festival 2008 line up is out</a>.

The idea is that you don\'t complicate your markup with Javascript and keep it all in include .js files. The JS files identify various spots in your pages via IDs or classes and attach event handlers at some point on page load time.\r\n\r\nSo far I\'m not a fan. I might warm up to it later, but I\'ve been working with it so far and its really hard for me to tell where the code is for anything. I\'ve got some piece of HTML, but finding out what it actually does or how to fix it when it stops doing what its supposed to is a pain. Just too \"transparent\".\r\n\r\nIts similar to various MVC patterns. Good factoring of code can be a really good thing. It can be crucial to build big projects that you can maintain. And I really do like the concept of keeping the HTML clean so that designers can work it it more easily without messing with script all over the place. But abstractions can go too far. I\'m also not a fan of the purist MVC models- I\'d rather have something that doesn\'t abstract so much that its hard to trace the actual code execution.\r\n\r\n','Transparent Javascript',0,'','publish','open','open','','transparent-javascript','','','2008-02-05 11:20:57','2008-02-05 18:20:57','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/02/05/transparent-javascript/',0,'post','',0),(355,2,'2008-02-06 14:57:12','2008-02-06 21:57:12','A good programmer\'s editor is probably one of the most important tools you can have. I\'ve been working with PHP and Javascript a bunch lately and the fact that I mostly use Visual Studio is really quite sad. It doesn\'t know anything about PHP and so far I\'ve not been that impressed by editing JavaScript in it either (its ok for debugging Javascript).\r\n\r\nSo I got mail today that the <a href=\"http://www.c-point.com/javascript_editor.php\">Antechnius JavaScript editor</a> is out with version 10. The big deal in the new version is that they merged the PHP and JavaScript editors. I have played with both before but never stuck with them at all, mostly because it sucked that there were two different ones. The notion of one environment for both sounds great.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it doesn\'t appear to have a \"find in files\" function. I use this <b>all day long</b> in VS. Find everywhere that calls foo(). Find this variable somewhere in the code-base. Especially when tackling a code-base that you aren\'t familiar with yet this is crucial. The editor has a notion of a \"project\" but it seems limited to providing a file browser and uploading things via FTP.\r\n\r\nIt does have a handy thing that picks out all the functions in the current file, but again, it doesn\'t know anything beyond the current file. So no help to find where foo() is declared.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t really support mixing HTML and Javascript. So debugging Javascript in stand-alone JS files is fine, but if you put it in your HTML file you can only execute a little bit at a time by selecting it and saying \"execute\". Its also not clear when you do that (or otherwise try out your Javascript) how it deals with bringing in includes and libraries and what-not.\r\n\r\nIt does let you run PHP stuff and do a syntax check, but its not really integrated. Its just running PHP.exe to do that, and displaying the results in a text window. You can\'t even click on errors to go to the right line and they do nothing to help with the poor error messages in the PHP engine (two examples- you can be missing a close parenthesis but it tells you unexpected \'{\', or forget to close a string and you get unexpected T_STRING, both referencing the wrong line. And yes, I know why the compiler gives the errors there, but its not user friendly and not really 2008-state-of-the-art).\r\n\r\nI\'ll play with it for a few more days but it feels like its still in the \"not quite enough to be useful\" category.\r\n\r\n','Antechinus JavaScript Editor v10',0,'','publish','open','open','','antechinus-javascript-editor-v10','','','2008-02-06 14:57:12','2008-02-06 21:57:12','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/02/06/antechinus-javascript-editor-v10/',0,'post','',0),(356,2,'2008-02-07 23:53:29','2008-02-08 06:53:29','My buddies at <a href=\"http://www.jacksonfish.com/\">Jackson Fish</a> <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/08/technology/08nation.html?_r=1&oref=slogin\">made the New York Times, with a picture even</a>!\r\n\r\nCongrats!

The key thing is that in a 1 out of a 100 occurrence, the Washington Caucus actually mattered, and the whole neighborhood seemed to have turned out. The local school that held ours was overflowing. I suspect they were 3-4x over the fire code and they still had a line of people looping around 3 sides of the block when they started going (I\'m pretty sure they managed to get everyone registered). I read some press reports quoting party folks saying the turnout was twice normal- the only folks I\'d talked to at the actual event who had been to a caucus since 1968 said it was more like 10x normal or more.\r\n\r\nAs Slate said it was \"more like a really disorganized primary\". There was some premise of speeches in theory trying to convince the undecided voters, but as Kat observed they ended up being directed more at the \"other side\" and didn\'t really sway anyone. The group of undecided folks in our precinct was small enough anyway that they didn\'t really matter at the end.\r\n\r\nSo a couple of observations-\r\n\r\n1) I\'ll retract my previous comments about the evils of the caucus system. I still don\'t love it- it excludes people who are out of town on business that day. It excludes people who have to work that day (there were reminders on the radio about leaving plenty of time to take the bus, but no reminders that the bus-drivers don\'t get a vote). I don\'t really feel like it added much over the primary system beyond the overall cool vibe that we were watching democracy in action with the whole neighborhood getting together.\r\n\r\n2) I had a conversation with a party official about the nomination process a couple of months ago. One of the key points he made defending the role of Iowa and New Hampshire is that those states take their role (often choosing the nominees) very seriously. Yesterday made it clear to me that Washington State takes that role just as seriously when given the chance. Hence its even more important to focus on breaking the strangle-hold that Iowa and New Hampshire have on our process.\r\n\r\n3) The super-delegate system is still very sketchy. I wish more of the super delegates would take the attitude that Barbara Boxer did when she announced before the California primary that her vote was going to go with whichever way the state popular vote went. It seems like we may be very much on track to have one candidate win the most delegates from the votes of the people but the other candidate win based on the super delegates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Washington Caucus',0,'','publish','open','open','','washington-caucus','','\nhttp://slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/02/09/mowing-down-the-plains.aspx','2008-02-10 12:20:21','2008-02-10 19:20:21','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/02/10/washington-caucus/',0,'post','',1),(359,2,'2008-02-21 09:46:13','2008-02-21 16:46:13','It is great to see Facebook taking some measures to reduce spam. Since I\'ve been working on some Facebook (and related) type things lately I think about these issues a lot.\r\n\r\nThe deeper issue is that the Facebook app authors are taking this \"land grab\" \"get rich quick\" approach. Except they aren\'t getting rich, they are getting \"users\" that when abused have no value.\r\n\r\nMy favorite latest example is Social.IM. This looked like a very cool thing- its an IM application that is integrated with Facebook so it automatically knows my Friends List from Facebook. This is a perfect example of the kind of application that really leverages the social networks knowledge of my interactions with others, while providing a useful function. If this app worked well, it would quickly be my main IM client.\r\n\r\nBut its currently on the road to being deleted from my machine for two reasons. The first is just that the client is not done very well. The chat flickers a ton, every time you type it jumps the whole window, and it has a huge block for every line you type with your user tile. After GTalk shipped, it felt like there was a new standard for the baseline experience in IM, and these guys are far from that to the point where using it is annoying.\r\n\r\nBut the worse problem is that they try to abuse me to spam my friends to install their thing. The saddest part here is they don\'t even need to- when I\'m running the app I have a list of my friends, those who are running Social.IM and those who aren\'t. If I want to talk to one of those that are not running it, I can click on their name and invite them. Great.\r\n\r\nWhy do they pester me to invite a bunch of people when I first sign up too? Completely unnecessary- your sign up experience should get people into your app as quickly as possible without that kind of hassle. Then I\'m chatting with someone and playing with the smiley\'s. They have some funny bigger ones, and I click on one to my shock my browser opens-\r\n\r\n<img src=\'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/socialimsux.png\' />\r\n\r\nThey want me to spam my friends to unlock some damn smiley\'s? This is classic \"abuse your customers\" stuff and I\'d thought it had gone out of fashion a few years ago but Social.IM has brought it back. Social.IM is going on my \"ban\" list until they cut this crap out.\r\n\r\nHopefully as people figure out how to make Facebook stuff sucesful, they will focus on customer value, great experiences, and making the social aspects (invites, news feeds, etc) tied to relevant things (like I want to chat with you) rather than spam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Facebook and Application Spam',0,'','publish','open','open','','facebook-and-application-spam','','','2008-02-21 09:46:13','2008-02-21 16:46:13','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/02/21/facebook-and-application-spam/',0,'post','',0),(361,2,'2008-02-21 09:45:45','2008-02-21 16:45:45','Social.IM Spamming Your Friends','Social.IM Spamming Your Friends',0,'','inherit','open','open','','socialim-spamming-your-friends','','','2008-02-21 09:45:45','2008-02-21 16:45:45','',359,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/02/socialimsux.png',0,'attachment','image/png',0),(362,2,'0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','It does a beep every time you receive a message, even when its window is on top.\r\n\r\nIt takes too much vertical space if you chat in little bits\r\n\r\nIt flashes the display a ton (this on a very fast computer)\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t seem to fully sync my status with my Facebook status.\r\n\r\n','Social.IM More Complaints',0,'','draft','open','open','','','','','0000-00-00 00:00:00','0000-00-00 00:00:00','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=362',0,'post','',0),(363,2,'2008-02-27 01:13:54','2008-02-27 08:13:54','My friend Matt Manger-Lynch died Sunday in a tragic bike accident.

I just installed it so no reports on its reliability yet. I did hit a glitch where it kept reporting that my \"server\" machine was rejecting the connections of the client one- changing to a different port solved this problem.

Most review sites are aimed at the extreme tweaker, first-person-shooter obsessed person. They typically involve people who go for maximum framerate for blasting their friends over visual quality.\r\n\r\nWhen I\'m looking for a video card I\'m interested in the following goals-\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Great basic support in Vista, etc, for large monitors. My current desktop rig is one 30\" LCD and a second 20\" LCD in portrait mode (so its the same pixel-height as the 30\").</li>\r\n<li>Support for common 3d games and applications at great visual quality. I\'m running them at 2560x1600 so my ideal is to be able to run at the highest visual settings at full screen resolution with a decent (>30fps) framerate. Typical targets here for me at WOW, Half-Life 2, Flight Simulator X, Google Earth, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Great media support. It should support H.264 and VC1 acceleration so I can run high definition video at full screen easily without taxing the CPU</li>\r\n<li>Reasonable price. I\'m unlikely to spend $600 on a video card (although sometimes I\'ve been tempted to spend $400).</li>\r\n<li>Stability. If the drivers crash a lot I\'m going to be very upset...</li>\r\n<li>Flexibility. SLI and Crossfire (dual card solutions) are a pain. Having said that I would consider them if the price is right, and especially for the flexibility of getting one card now and another later. The fact that the standard Intel chipsets don\'t support SLI is a major mark agaisnt Nvidia.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThis guide will try to list all the models on the market in order of descending prices. I\'ll mark what date I look up a given price, and prices are typically taken from <a href=\"http://www.newegg.com\">NewEgg</a>. NewEgg doesn\'t always have the best price but they are usually representative and they have been great when I\'ve needed to do returns.\r\n\r\nI should also mention that I have not tried most of these cards myself and have benchmarked almost none of them. I\'ll be pulling benchmark data from <a href=\"http://www.anandtech.com\">AnandTech</a> and <a href=\"http://www.tomshardware.com\">Tom\'s Hardware</a> and other sources. I\'m mostly reading their reviews and reinterpreting them in the context of the goals above, plus organizing the list a bit.\r\n\r\n<h3>Recommendations</h3>\r\nAs I write this June 25, 2008, the new card lineups for ATI and NVidia are rolling out. They both look like pretty impressive improvements and the final details are still coming out. However, it looks like for our criteria the big winner is going to be the ATI HD4850. This card is inexpensive (can be found for $159 with rebates), runs just about every current game just fine at 2560x1600 resolution, uses relatively low power and only takes a single slot.\r\n\r\nThe ATI 4870 costs 50% more but only gives about 20% better performance. A better bet would be if you need more performance to get two 4850s (using Crossfire which is supported by most of the better Intel chipsets) which together appear to be way faster than the 4870 and for only a little bit more. The nice thing is that you can get one now, and a second one later as new games come out that need the extra horsepower. The dual 4850 setup appears to be very close to the performance of the dual 4870 setup, and at $320 costs just about as much as a single 4870.\r\n\r\nThe other thing that could be nice about the Crossfire route would be having 4 DVI ports that would in theory let you attach 4 monitors. Presumably you can\'t use them all for playing games, but you could use them normally. I\'m not sure if cross-fire mode allows this though or if the extra ports have to be unused, or what switching modes is like. The big disadvantage is that I\'d still be concerned about driver stability for Crossfire operation since its just that much more complicated and less mainstream. You also still need to worry quite a bit about heat from running those two boards each of which is consuming quite a bit of power.\r\n\r\nThe two companies seem to have gone for a real split in philosophy although I\'m sure some of that is driven by their approaches to working around underlying fab and technology issues. NVidia just introduced their new generation of super-massive, super-powerful chips. These are pretty much on the extreme high-end starting at $400 with the higher end chip hitting a solid $600. They have great performance, but are power hungry and expensive. To fill in the mid-range segment they sell you the previous generation chips, with the most noticeable being the 9800GTX that was just introduced for $220. This one delivers good price-performance but is still power hungry and its realistically last generations technology (with the impact on video decoding and such still unclear).\r\n\r\nATI on the other hand doesn\'t have any single chips that can challenge the NVidia high end- they are pushing more mid-range chips, but seem to have invested a ton in having them run as pairs, so their high end cards typically bundle two of those chips on the same card. Now, once you put two chips on a card its just as expensive and possibly even uses more power than the NVidia approach, but the single-chip versions seem to fit really nicely into the mid-range \"good gaming performance, great Vista workstation, great media support\" that we are looking for in this guide.\r\n\r\n<h3>The List</h3>\r\n(In descending order of price)\r\n\r\n<h4>NVidia GF9800GX2 1GB (2x512MB)</h4>\r\n$580 (4/1/2008). \r\n\r\n<h4>ATI Radeon HD3870X2 1GB (2x512MB)</h4>\r\n$400 (4/1/2008). Pretty good choice on the high end. Basically two HD3870s together on one card, but it costs a bit more than two 3870s.\r\n\r\n<h4>NVidia GF9800GTX+ 512MB</h4>\r\n$230 (6/21/2008). This is the only other real alternative to the ATI 4850 right now. Nice card with great gaming performance although its just a faster clocked version of the previous generation of technology.\r\n\r\n<h4>NVidia GF8800GT 512MB</h4>\r\n$200 (4/1/2008). I don\'t know why you would buy this anymore- the ATI HD3870 is as fast/faster on most games, costs less, has better media support, and is easier to pair up.\r\n\r\n<h3>ATI Radeon HD4850 512MB</h3>\r\n$180 (6/21/2008). This is my basic mid-high recommendation. Overall very solid board, good 3d, great media support.\r\n\r\n<h4>NVidia GF9600GT 512MB</h4>\r\n$150 (4/1/2008)\r\n\r\n<h4>ATI Radeon HD3850 256MB</h4>\r\n$130 (4/1/2008). I\'d strongly consider getting this instead of the HD3870 for a machine that I don\'t expect to play any games on- it should be more than enough for normal Vista usage, it has the same great media support as the HD3870, etc. Its just not as great at the 3d games- on some games at 2560x1600 resolution it does about half the frame-rate as the HD3870, although at lower screen sizes its only about 25% slower (and for some older games the two are very close).\r\n\r\n<h4>NVidia GF8600GTS 256MB</h4>\r\n$100 (4/1/2008). This is a decent card on the low-mid range. Not really good for any 3d games but it is what I have in my main media center box right now. It actually has better media decoding support than the twice-as-expensive GF8800GT. Having said that if I were buying a new card now I\'d probably get the slightly more expensive ATI Radeon HD3850 which appears to have even better media support and is slightly less underpowered on the 3d front. \r\n\r\n<h4>ATI Radeon HD3470</h4>\r\n$65 (4/1/2008). Can be found without a fan- might be decent for a media-center machine, although its not clear if it has enough horsepower for one with a bigger display.\r\n\r\n<h4>ATI Radeon HD3450</h4>\r\n$40 (4/1/2008)','Video Card Guide',0,'','publish','open','open','','video-card-guide','','','2008-07-14 00:08:22','2008-07-14 07:08:22','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/video-card-guide/',0,'page','',5),(374,2,'2008-04-01 13:23:49','2008-04-01 20:23:49','Reading my 500th video card review today I realized that the typical video card review sites don\'t really cover the stuff that I care about. Also this stuff changes all the time and there are rarely good places to go to just figure out what is the right stuff to get now. So I decide to post a page that contains my <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/video-card-guide/\">Video Card Guide</a>.\r\n\r\nWhen I\'m looking for a video card I\'m interested in the following goals-\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Great basic support in Vista, etc, for large monitors. My current desktop rig is one 30\" LCD and a second 20\" LCD in portrait mode (so its the same pixel-height as the 30\").</li>\r\n<li>Support for common 3d games and applications at great visual quality. I\'m running them at 2560x1600 so my ideal is to be able to run at the highest visual settings at full screen resolution with a decent (>30fps) framerate. Typical targets here for me at WOW, Half-Life 2, Flight Simulator X, Google Earth, etc.</li>\r\n<li>Great media support. It should support H.264 and VC1 acceleration so I can run high definition video at full screen easily without taxing the CPU</li>\r\n<li>Reasonable price. I\'m unlikely to spend $600 on a video card (although sometimes I\'ve been tempted to spend $400).</li>\r\n<li>Stability. If the drivers crash a lot I\'m going to be very upset...</li>\r\n<li>Flexibility. SLI and Crossfire (dual card solutions) are a pain. Having said that I would consider them if the price is right, and especially for the flexibility of getting one card now and another later. The fact that the standard Intel chipsets don\'t support SLI is a major mark agaisnt Nvidia.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n','Video Card Guide',0,'','publish','open','open','','video-card-guide','','\nhttp://www.alexhopmann.com/video-card-guide/','2008-04-01 13:23:49','2008-04-01 20:23:49','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/04/01/video-card-guide/',0,'post','',0),(375,2,'2008-04-01 16:52:06','2008-04-01 23:52:06','I\'ve had a Gigabit Ethernet network for quite some time but have mostly been using older Cat5 cables.

A friend just booked a flight on American and they booked her through Dallas Fort-Worth with a 40-minute layover. Considering that they give your seats away 30 min before the \"flight time\", close the doors 20 minutes before the flight time, and that it usually takes a minimum of 15 minutes to get between gates there (30-40 if you don\'t do a full out run) this is crazy.\r\n\r\nI CAN\'T BELIEVE THESE GUYS ARE STILL IN BUSINESS. The only explanation is to again recall that these policies are designed to be intentionally consumer unfriendly by forcing you to miss flights and thus helping them avoid bump-charges.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago we flew out to Washington DC. This time we took Alaska Airlines. So same pair of airports (Seatac, National). But the difference couldn\'t be more striking. The Alaska flights were non-stop. The airplanes were in good condition compared to the American ones. The staff was friendly and helpful- this guy had forgotten his day-planner at the check-in station, and not only did they make 3 announcements in the gate area for him, but they actually brought it down through security so he wouldn\'t have to run back to the check-in area and back through security. The cabin crew was nice, the pilots gave us helpful advice. And we were a few minutes late into Seattle so they asked people who didn\'t have connections to let the 17 folks with tight connections off first.\r\n\r\nNow, let me be clear. It probably doesn\'t actually make a real world difference. But if you are that person stressing about your connection, just the simple fact that the crew is expressing sympathy and a desire to help with your plight makes 1000% difference in how you feel about the situation. After letting the folks with connections off I thanked the crew as we left- they said that what they did was against policy. And its a shame that its against policy, but the more important thing is that their employees aren\'t taking their frustration out on customers and actually seem to recall they are in a service industry. They were friendly and helpful. And that makes all the difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','American Airlines Still Sucks',0,'','publish','open','open','','american-airlines-still-sucks','','','2009-09-17 08:32:37','2009-09-17 15:32:37','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/04/03/american-airlines-still-sucks/',0,'post','',3),(377,2,'2008-04-08 10:46:18','2008-04-08 17:46:18','Exciting day on the new music front.

Unfortunately I\'ve barely been able to use it. Many of my friends I\'m sure will complain about the lack of Mac support so far, but for me the lack of Windows support is worse.\r\n\r\nIt doesn\'t work on my Vista machines- for some reason at this point it requires User Account Control (UAC) to be \"on\" (but of course won\'t run on an account that doesn\'t have admin privileges. I\'m not going to rant too much about this yet since I\'m hoping its just because its an early release. But this one is really confusing unless its something some wacko did to try to push UAC (EVIL!) on people. There is really nothing you can do with UAC on that won\'t work with it off. Again, I\'m hoping this is just one of those wacky bugs that got punted at the last minute for this early release...\r\n\r\nIt also doesn\'t work on Server. So one of the more useful machines for me to sync to- the server box that I keep all my important data on, can\'t play. This isn\'t a normal \"home\" scenario, except that Microsoft is trying to push Home Server (I\'m not running Home Server, but the install error pertty clearly said XP SP2 and Vista only). Again, I\'m hoping this is just early release stuff.\r\n\r\nThen one of my XP machines has Firefox as its default browser. The Mesh client bits keep poping URLs, but since Firefox can\'t run the ActiveX associated with them, it fails. Here I feel some sympathy with Microsoft. The ideal solution would be if your UI requires Internet Explorer, launch IE directly instead of the machines configured \"default browser\". However given the wacky government regulation of Microsoft they would likely get in trouble for doing this sensible thing, and so its yet another aspect that doesn\'t really run correctly for me.\r\n\r\nSo, someday I hope to report on Mesh itself, but its not going to happen yet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Mesh First Impressions',0,'','publish','open','open','','mesh-first-impressions','','','2008-04-24 10:15:08','2008-04-24 17:15:08','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/04/24/mesh-first-impressions/',0,'post','',2),(380,2,'2008-04-24 13:11:49','2008-04-24 20:11:49','The following is adapted from an email I sent to the <a href=\"http://seattletechstartups.com/\">Seattle Tech Startups</a> mailing list. The conversation started when someone asked about peoples experience with EC2. Eventually someone pointed out that its important to take into account your time when doing the cost calculations between EC2 vs. building out your own data center, pointing out that many people don\'t take into account how much effort goes into building out and running a data center.\r\n\r\nHowever I donâ€™t buy the argument that somehow running EC2 magically uses a lot less of your time than running your own data center. Iâ€™ve seen this argument many times, but frankly the cost of sticking a couple of servers in the data center in terms of time maintaining the hardware can be very low. And the time to maintain EC2, write custom code to maintain your instances, deal with the quirks of their environment, build extra code to deal with their failure modes can easily overwhelm the time it takes to stick a couple of boxes in a rack somewhere.\r\n\r\nEventually these environments might get more automatic- one of the nice things about the the Google Engine stuff is that as far as I can tell itâ€™s a heck of a lot more self-managing than EC2. But for right now, either way you are going to spend a bunch of time on OPs, and the hardware aspect of it will be the low order bitsâ€¦\r\n\r\nJust as an example- I stuck a server in a data center in December 2006. I havenâ€™t touched it since (physically). So it took me a few hours to setup, and since then Iâ€™ve been lucky and its been trouble-free. Sure I have to make sure the OS updates (er, all 3 of them since Iâ€™m running VMs on it). But the same is true for your EC2 images. Since I installed it my server has given me the equivalent of $4000 worth of EC2 time, and it cost me $3000 ($1600 + ~$1200 in hosting fees). Because its running a really simple configuration and I have direct control over it, its saved me far more than that in ease of development time.\r\n\r\nSure you say, but Iâ€™m going to be huge and will need to manage 20+ servers. However, at that point you are going to need someone to deal with ops. 20 servers in EC2 arenâ€™t going to manage themselves any more than 20 will in a data center. Now granted, in EC2 you can scale up from 1 instance to 60 (equivalent of the 20 servers) in an instant by just kicking off those instances, right? But is your software really designed so you can just duplicate your machine image 60 times and it works right? If I need more machines in my data-center I can call up Dell and have them installed in a week. Sure its not over-night, but unless you hit the lottery and get an unexpected extreme traffic spike, it will usually work out. Even with 20 machines (this is based on some recent experience at <a href=\"http://www.deeprockdrive.com\">DeepRockDrive</a>)  the hardware part of the setup is likely only a couple of hours to unpack all the deliveries from Dell, plug them into some good power, run some network cables, and flip on all the switches. Set things up right and from that point you have just created a single OS image and can just copy that image to all of the machines. In other words, once the physical hardware is plugged in, the software part works pretty much the same as EC2 does. (Disclaimer- there are lots of more complicated and time consuming ways to do this, so I\'m sure many folks have examples of times it took weeks. But modern OS imaging if you know what you are doing is very cool and works great.) \r\n\r\nAs part of a recent project I did some cost calculations. Just working in to the equation raw CPU, EC2 can be cost effective if your daily traffic pattern exceeds a 8-1 ratio. In other words, if you expect that you will need ~8 instances for 3 hours a day and can get by with just 1 instance for the other 21 hours, it can be cost effective. That is some pretty extreme peaks- keep in mind that if those other 21 hours you actually need 2 instances the peak would have to be 16 to be justified. Of course that is assuming that scaling is just a matter of CPU- depending on how you build your site, your scale limiting factor might e something like your MySql database, in which case the super-large instance is still not as big as you can buy with commodity hardware (even in 1u factor) so you just have an upper limit with EC2. The biggest EC2 instance the \"extra large\" provides 8 EC2 \"compute units\" while an 8-core Xeon system you can configure from Dell for less than $3000 should be able to provide the equivalent of 24 \"compute units\" in one instance.\r\n\r\nOne really key disclaimer here- my calculations were not factoring in bandwidth. The best part of EC2 as far as I can tell is that the bandwidth charges are really really low compared to what you are going to see in your own datacenter so if bandwidth is going to be a major cost factor, that does tip in the favor of EC2, and they even announced some price-cuts coming next month so that angle does get even better in favor of the EC2 route. I have to admit that with the progress of technology I\'m really surprised that prices don\'t seem to have dropped that much on bandwidth charges at the big co-location centers. \r\n\r\nIn any case, back to the main point- Ops in EC2 are not free. The Ops tasks are different than with a conventional data-center, but its not at all clear that one or the other requires less time on ops-type tasks. These types of services have a great potential, but right now they are still in their infancy. Building a â€œconventionalâ€ site is something that there are some very well established practices around, both for site architecture and ops. Granted, especially in this area there are some EC2 experts, but Iâ€™d really think twice about tackling it unless you have one of those experts on your team. When you look at your new business, do you want to distinguish yourself with your new service for your customers, or by innovating in how you host it? \r\n','Some Comments on EC2 and Ops',0,'','publish','open','open','','some-comments-on-ec2-and-ops','','','2008-04-24 13:11:49','2008-04-24 20:11:49','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/04/24/some-comments-on-ec2-and-ops/',0,'post','',0),(381,2,'2008-04-27 23:56:28','2008-04-28 06:56:28','<a href=\'http://www.elliott.org/blog/bumping-games-how-american-redefined-denied-boarding/\'>Elliot.org brings us more stories of how American Airlines is manipulating the system to avoid having to pay bump-fees</a>.

I know some great developers who understand enough about how the inner stuff works that I\'m sure they can make scalable Rails applications, but I\'ve also seen most that aren\'t.\r\n\r\n','Twitter, Ruby on Rails and Scalability',0,'','publish','open','open','','twitter-ruby-on-rails-and-scalability','','','2008-05-12 20:00:44','2008-05-13 03:00:44','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/05/12/twitter-ruby-on-rails-and-scalability/',0,'post','',0),(387,2,'2008-05-21 19:30:56','2008-05-22 02:30:56','Stuff at <a href=\"http://www.deeprockdrive.com\">DeepRockDrive</a> has been pretty exciting lately- bigger and bigger shows, some VC visits, scaling up the new site, and all that.

But the Washington state based Sasquatch festival had expanded to three days and had a great line up, so we planned another long weekend with rafting in the morning and shows at night.\r\n\r\nSaturday we got there in time for the New Pornographers. Actually we had a few minutes to spare and stopped by the Xbox / Rockband tent where they were running a competition. Unfortunately you needed 4 people to enter and we failed to put together a team that could get decent scores.\r\n\r\nFinally we ran off to see the New Pornographers. The show was great, although speaking of Rockband it was too bad they didn\'t play Electric Version which is in the game.\r\n\r\nModest Mouse was great, but unfortunately they scheduled it at the same time as the Breeders which was a pretty painful conflict for me. We left Modest Mouse only to stand around for 15 minutes as the Breeders were late to get their set going. I was also a bit apprehensive since the new Breeders album is not that great. Luckily it was worth the wait- the Breeders show was awesome and everything had a great energy.\r\n\r\nFinally we went back to the main stage to see R.E.M. Of all the bands that I\'ve followed so much, R.E.M. is pretty much the only one that I had never seen live. The set was very good and it was really fun for me to see them finally. I loved that they did some good obscure stuff off of \"Fables/Reconstruction of the\" and Harborcoat. On the other hand they didn\'t play anything from Life\'s Rich Pageant or \r\nMurmer which was a bit disappointing. Still, it was great to see them and I enjoyed it a ton.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday we got there just in time to see Mates of State. The set was pretty good but I really didn\'t recognize anything. Before festivals like this I often try to use them as an excuse to check out new music and try to listen to the bands ahead of time. I had been listening to Mates of State a bunch but still didn\'t recognize anything.\r\n\r\nAfter Mates of State we got our spot and I went back to the second stage to see the Kooks. They were VERY late. Crazy late. At least 45 minutes and maybe more. At a club that may be fine, but at a festival where you have to make difficult choices being that late is just unprofessional and rude since people are skipping other shows to sit in front of your stage and wait for you to play. Sometimes there are big equipment failures and I understand that, but this just seemed like a normal lazy setup. In the end I only saw 15 minutes of the Kooks who are a decent Kaiser Chiefs/Strokes style band.\r\n\r\nDeath Cab for Cutie was good, although as Pitchfork mentioned it feels like it would be much cooler to see them in a club- they have a hard time translating to the huge stage. Of course they are so popular now that is probably difficult- it was packed for them and many people started leaving before the Cure I think.\r\n\r\nFinally I thought that the Cure were great. I was prepared to not be that into it- there are really only a couple of songs that I like that they have done post-Disintegration. They played a bunch of post-Disintegration stuff (including both of the songs that I do like) but they also played a TON of stuff off Disintegration that worked really well, and the second encore that was more than half of their first album was great. Doing it as just a 4-piece band helped them stick to a more focused sound and I think was pretty key to it being a good show.\r\n\r\nFinally we skipped the third day- we were pretty tired and were not excited about the thought of driving back late at night in Memorial Day traffic. I can see some of the good thoughts about expanding to three days but for me its just too much and I\'d rather they stick to just the Saturday/Sunday and give everyone Monday off to relax without missing any great shows.\r\n\r\nThe Gorge is as always a beautiful venue, Late May is a bit early for this area of the country since the weather is often sketchy. It rained a bit this year but at least no hail and it wasn\'t freezing like last year. I also noticed what felt to me like a bunch more obnoxiously drunken people around. Maybe I just haven\'t been paying attention but I saw more staggering, puking, people doing wacky drunken things than at previous shows, and finally some jerk started yelling at Kat during the Cure because she was \"in his way\" and threw a beer and pretty much ruined the show for her. Very disappointing that people were getting that out of control.\r\n','Sasquatch 2008',0,'','publish','open','open','','sasquatch-2008','','','2008-05-28 13:16:57','2008-05-28 20:16:57','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/05/28/sasquatch-2008/',0,'post','',0),(393,2,'2008-06-03 09:24:18','2008-06-03 16:24:18','<a href=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/ChurchOfTheCustomer/~3/303820781/southwest-airli.html\">From the Church of the Customer blog</a> about how a crew on Southwest treated a passenger\'s birthday with a \"cake\" and some singing.

I\'m looking forward to checking this out soon- we have had a ton of success using memcache on the LAMP platform and it was a missing piece in the .NET world. I understand why it was a bit hard to see its importance in that environment- Unlike PHP, .NET can persist things in memory in between requests. PHP really needs memcache quickly since you can\'t really save anything from request to request so you go to the database very quickly. But as your system grows Memcache fills an even more important role because of how easily you can scale out adding more caching servers.\r\n\r\nMemcache (at least the standard one) has a few problem scenarios all revolving around how it so easily shares the load between servers. The coolest thing about memcache is how simple of a mechanism it is- no complex configuration to tune (there are a few things to tune), maintain, debug. You simply configure N memcache servers on all your web server, and when you save or retrieve an object, it takes the \'key\' (an arbitrary string), hashes it and uses the hash to pick one of the memcache servers (in effect it does H(key)%N where H is the hashing function and N is the number of servers). In effeect you automatically get a smooth distribution of your keys across your caching servers.\r\n\r\nHowever, if you add or remove memcache servers from the array, it changes the hash, so all of the sudden your keys are on different servers. Now, if your site is under low load, this isn\'t that big a deal- you just dumped your whole cache and it will build back up and be fine. But if you are running memcache because you really need it, your site just went down as all the web-servers just started pounding directly on the database with every request. Right now DeepRockDrive has a pretty unique situation where we get huge spikes of traffic (that are mostly predictable- showtime) during which the memcache servers really save our bacon, and most of the time we can clear them out more or less safely, but most big sites are going to have a more consistent traffic pattern and would have a harder time with this.\r\n\r\nThis also means that if you a memcache server goes down you can\'t just pull it out of your configuration (at least under normal load). You really really need to replace it. The easiest (although resource intensive) way to do this is to just have a hot-spare server or two in your track. If one of your memcache servers goes down, you map that spare to the same IP and bring it up. You just lost a portion of your cache (10% if you have 10 servers, etc..), but its way better than losing the whole thing. A more complicated setup would be to run multiple instances of memcache on every machine. So if you have 10 memcache machines, you run each with 3 IPs and it looks like your whole array is 30 \"servers\". If one goes down, you bring those 3 IPs up on 3 of the other machines distributing some of its load to those machines.\r\n\r\nWe hadn\'t had a chance to fully work out the scalability of the standard memcached running with multiple instances on the same box so far. We have played with it some and on our 8-core boxes even with the right threading libraries we haven\'t gotten close to maxing it out with a single instance of memcache. It looks like there may be some I/O limits but I can\'t be sure about what is actually going on, still the notion of running multiple instances on the same box seems like a fairly reasonable one for scalability and these fail-over flexibility cases.\r\n\r\nThe other tricky issue is that memcache gives you a balanced distribution of keys but does not necessarily give you a balanced distribution of access. Lets say you had some runtime configuration information that you wanted to persist on your site. The easy thing to do would be to save it in a key called \'config\' and just retrieve that key on every request. \r\n\r\nWhat you have accomplished here is to just introduce a nice hard-scalability limit into your system. Memcache isn\'t actually that much faster than MySql is for basic queries. If MySql can cache the query well (as it would be able to for a query on a simple table that just gets hit over and over), the performance of the two will be pretty similar. Where memcache shines is that because of how its keys and the hashing thing work, it can transparently distribute that load over the multiple servers. So the person building the app with the \'config\' key will have something that looks great as its small and on one caching server and then when they try to apply it to a high load site with multiple servers. All the traffic still just goes to the one memcache server (since its one key that gets hashed the same every time) and they will typically be stumped why the performance isn\'t better.\r\n\r\nThe way around this is to generate keys that look something like-\r\n\r\n\'config-\'.rand(0,9)\r\n\r\n(php syntax)\r\n\r\nAt first this is counter-intuitive. I\'m storing the same thing in 10 keys? That means that when they expire I\'m going to have to go back and do 10x the initial loading of this object (whether from the database or config files or whatnot). However, at the cost of a very small # of those database queries (they only happen once every 5 or 60 minutes right), I\'m spreading my keys out across my memcache array and the result is that the load gets spread smoothly across my whole array. I can even do a couple of slick extra things like every time I refresh the config data write to all 10 keys at once, resulting in no extra load on the database (except for a race condition I\'ll cover in a future post) and just a small amount of occasional load on one web server.\r\n\r\nI started this post mentioning Microsoft Velocity and then went into memcache- looping back to Velocity, in typical Microsoft fashion it looks like its a much more complicated solution, but it also automatically deals with some of the above issues. As far as I can tell from a few architecture diagrams the servers maintain knowledge of a cluster (memcache servers have no idea about each other) and I\'d assume they automatically deal with some of the fail-over and \"add a server\" cases. It also has a more explicit concurrency model- although memcache supports building things with much of the same concurrency behavior you need to manage it a bunch more yourself.\r\n\r\nLooking forward to checking out velocity more later. In particular I\'m interested in when the protocol to talk to the servers will be published and whether there will be support for PHP/Python clients talking to these servers.\r\n\r\n','Microsoft Velocity and Memcache',0,'','publish','open','open','','microsoft-velocity-and-memcache','','','2008-06-09 09:09:21','2008-06-09 16:09:21','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/09/microsoft-velocity-and-memcache/',0,'post','',7),(395,2,'2008-06-10 13:15:57','2008-06-10 20:15:57','<a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/05/23/diy-laptop-solid-state-drive/\">A couple of weeks ago I wrote about problems trying to get my SSD drive working in my laptop</a>. Since then I\'ve done some experimentation and figured out the issues.\r\n\r\nInitially I bought a RiData 32GB CF card (266x speed) and a SYBA SY-SATA2CF CF to SATA Adapter. It wasn\'t working (would hang in Windows setup or boot) but I couldn\'t tell which component was at fault. Since then I noticed that <a href=\"http://www.sansdigital.com/compact-flash-storage/cr2t.html\">Sans Digital has the CS2T</a> CF adapter which is shaped like a 2.5\" drive and accepts two CF cards. Its a lot more expensive than the Syba adapter ($99 vs. $18), but it works and $18 isn\'t a bargain for a card that I just couldn\'t get work right.\r\n\r\nHaving the Sans Digital be shaped like a normal drive is also a huge help. With laptops you often need to insert the thing way back into the case and they all pretty much assume the standard drive form factor. The Syba was a big pain to get in but the Sans Digital fits into my Dell laptop easily. Once I could tell it worked I bought a second RiData 32GB card and was able to just insert it and expand my volume in Windows- Presto! 64GB SSD drive for $290. It runs Vista great and I\'ve installed Voyager (flight planning software) so I should be able to use it in the airplane.\r\n\r\nI should mention that I\'ve bought several products from Sans Digital so far- I\'ve also gotten both of their 4-drive SATA external enclosures, the USB TR4U and the eSATA TR4M.

Lets say you are using memcache to cache an object that you want to refresh at least every 5 minutes. The typical pattern for this would be (in PHP)-\r\n\r\n<pre>$myobj = $memcache->get(\'key\');\r\nif($myobj == NULL)\r\n{\r\n  $myobj = LoadMyObjFromMySql();\r\n  $memcache->set(\'key\', $myobj, 300);\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nWith this code you should expect to see one query on your database every 5 minutes. But implement this on a high capacity web site and you will probably see your MySql database get pegged every 5 minutes with a spike of a ton of queries. What is going on?\r\n\r\nNotice that there is a time window in between the memcache get, the database query and the memcache set. This window isn\'t large, but it could easily be 10ms. On a web site that is running 1000 requests per second you could easily have 10 different requests where the memcache get fails (because the object is expired), and they each hit the database before they update the memcache and everything is back to normal.\r\n\r\nThe solution is to not rely on memcache to manage the expiration. We can rewrite the code above to look more like-\r\n\r\n<pre>$myobj = $memcache->get(\'key\');\r\nif($myobj == NULL || $myobj->expire + rand(0,120) < time())\r\n{\r\n  $myobj = LoadMyObjFromMySql();\r\n  $myobj->expire = time() + 300;\r\n  $memcache->set(\'key\', $myobj, 600);\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\nThis way memcache still has an expiration for the objects, but its longer than our real target. For the first 300 seconds the objects always just get loaded from the memcache server. Starting at 300 seconds there is a tiny chance that each request will refresh from the database and update the memcache. This way if there is a large load on the server, the chances are that only 1 or 2 updates will happen, but that it will happen right away. If there is a lighter load within 7 minutes the object will eventually get expired for sure. So the chance that any given request will refresh the cache ends up being inversely proportional to the current load.\r\n\r\nThe above code of course relies on you storing PHP \"objects\" in the memcache so it can tag the extra expire property on. If you aren\'t storing something that is already an object you can always create a new object that stores your real thing in a property called \"data\" and still uses expire. You will pay a small overhead for the object marshaling but it shouldn\'t be too painful.\r\n','Memcache Race Condition Fun',0,'','publish','open','open','','memcache-race-condition-fun','','','2008-06-13 11:26:41','2008-06-13 18:26:41','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/13/memcache-race-condition-fun/',0,'post','',4),(397,2,'2008-06-17 16:06:06','2008-06-17 23:06:06','<a href=\"http://clearcoolhead.blogspot.com/2008/06/more-on-airline-fees-and-la-carte.html\">My buddy Eric Berman writes about how badly the major airlines have screwed up their recent pricing changes where they charge for checked bags and nickel and dime you on every bit</a>. For what its worth Eric is a former exec at Expedia which I think qualifies him as an expert on aspects of the travel industry. The main point is that there were totally different ways to position this- \"we aren\'t going to charge you for stuff you might not use\". They sort of successfully did that with most of the changes in in-flight meals. Considering how bad they were I haven\'t minded that they don\'t provide them anymore as long as I can bring my own food on. What scares me about the checked baggage thing is that the result will be even more people competing for the limited overhead space, and many of them will be infrequent travelers with huge over-packed bags. This could easily turn into a mess with 15 minutes of extra boarding time which would quickly cost the airlines more than they are saving in the first place.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile <a href=\"http://www.37signals.com/svn/posts/1081-alaska-airlines-saves-millions-by-rethinking-check-in-flow\">Signal vs. Noise writes about how Alaska Airlines did some smart research to redesign the check in area</a> in Seattle with a projected savings of $8 million this year. Alaska has actually been doing this kind of thing for years- a very long time ago they were one of the first to put kiosks in the Seattle airport. Back then I was flying them a lot and it was great to walk from the parking garage and be able to hit the kiosk right away (before you got up to the full mess of the check-in area) and it would print out your boarding pass with the gate # right there. No milling around looking for the right place and the frequent Alaska travelers got to skip the whole mess.\r\n\r\nIts things like this (as well as my recent experiences flying from Washington DC back to Seattle) that put Alaska Airlines in the \"new airline\" camp. They may have been around for 80 years or so but mostly they still behave more like Southwest and JetBlue than like an old-school airline (American, United, etc...)\r\n','Airlines, a-la-carte pricing and Smart Designs',0,'','publish','open','open','','airlines-a-la-carte-pricing-and-smart-designs','','','2008-06-17 16:06:06','2008-06-17 23:06:06','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/17/airlines-a-la-carte-pricing-and-smart-designs/',0,'post','',0),(398,2,'2008-06-18 19:38:10','2008-06-19 02:38:10','I\'m having a problem installing Vista SP1 on my main workstation.

We have a different take on office hours at <a href=\"http://www.deeprockdrive.com/\">DeepRockDrive</a> but so far it works out really well and I thought it would be interesting to share.\r\n\r\nWhen I started working with <a href=\"http://www.deeprockdrive.com/\">DeepRockDrive</a> the technology folks up here in the Seattle area didn\'t have a real office at all yet. Folks just met most days in a coffee shop and would hang out and work on the code. There were a few contractors scattered off around various parts of the world and people would often work at home. Everyone would log in to Skype all day in a common chat room so you get the similar concept to shouting over to the guy at the desk near you.\r\n\r\nWe have had an office now for several months, but its over in Bellevue. Our staff is all over the Puget Sound area and traffic isn\'t so wonderful around here most of the time. I was hoping we could maintain some of the culture of being able to avoid wasting 40-60 minutes a day in traffic plus the advantages of being able to concentrate at my home office (not to mention reducing the environmental impact of all that driving especially in stop and go traffic). At the same time to act as a well oiled agile startup we need to have great communication with each other and it was sometimes really difficult to find a time when all the right people were around to discuss a given topic.\r\n\r\nWhat we came up with was the concept of \"core office hours\". This is roughly Monday, Wednesday and Friday from 10am to 3pm. During those times people are expected to be in the office (with the obvious exceptions for vacation, travel, important appointments, etc). Those are great times to schedule a meeting, plus you can usually pull together the right people for an impromptu meeting for just about anything. But, with the limited hours this also helps prevent our schedules from filling up with constant meetings so we have solid times to get code done, tested, write important documents, etc. On Tuesday and Thursdays I can avoid getting in the car at all. On Monday, Wednesday and Friday when I do need to go into the office I can do it at a time when traffic is WAY better (20min vs 40-60) plus its a nicer time if you want to bike too.\r\n\r\nSo far overall I\'d say this system is working great, but I do have a few thoughts about some considerations that are necessary to make it work-\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It is not going to work for all job roles. Some types of jobs require you to be at the central place where people can be there together. And the job needs to be something where the output is pretty measurable- if you can\'t tell if someone is goofing off, its going to breed ill-will. If the job is something where the results speak for themselves (amount of code written, bugs found, etc) it is a good fit.</li>\r\n<li>It is not going to work for all people. To make this work you need people that are very self-motivated and self-starting.</li>\r\n<li>The Skype thing helps us a ton (although any other form of live chat-room with presence information also works). It helps both give us that ability to communicate and get problems solved with colleagues in real time, as well as helps people be visibly \"on the job\".</li>\r\n<li>It helps to have good network resources. We rely on a combination of the Skype stuff, as well as GMail, Google Docs, Basecamp, and an SVN and Trac server that we have deployed in our data-center. I\'d also point out that all of those services are accessible without VPN so our staff can easily work on stuff from home / a cafe / vacation / the road. In theory having to VPN shouldn\'t matter but I\'ve always found it to be a big barrier to getting real work done.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Office Hours',0,'','publish','open','open','','office-hours','','','2008-06-18 20:40:43','2008-06-19 03:40:43','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/18/office-hours/',0,'post','',0),(400,2,'2008-06-19 13:10:32','2008-06-19 20:10:32','<a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/18/problems-installing-vista-sp1/\">Yesterday I wrote about problems installing Vista SP1 on this machine</a>. Running the \"download and run it yourself\" installer worked fine with one little glitch. The issue was that I first downloaded the SP1 setup that only contained 5 languages, thinking \"hey, I only really actually care about English\". The catch is that it won\'t run if you have any languages other than those 5 installed. I had previously installed a ton of languages since they were just check boxes in Windows Update.\r\n\r\nUninstalling languages turned out to be a nightmare. First of all, you can\'t uninstall from \"Programs and Features\", you have to go into \"Regional and Language Options\", go into the \"Keyboards and Languages\" tab, click a button, click another button. Then most of my attempts to remove languages would fail (after sitting doing something to my computer for what seemed like 30 minutes), PLUS it requires a reboot after each one (even though I\'m uninstalling languages I\'ve never ever used).\r\n\r\nSo the solution ended up being downloading the \"all languages\" version of the Vista SP1 package. The 20 minutes the download took was way faster than uninstalling the languages. Upgrade felt like it took a long time- I could be wrong but it feels slower than initial setup (which does make some sense since initial setup can just write an image down on your disk while upgrade is presumably doing more real work).\r\n\r\nAll is well now and so far the machine is running smoothly.\r\n\r\n','Installing Vista SP1 Follow Up',0,'','publish','open','open','','installing-vista-sp1-follow-up','','\nhttp://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/18/problems-installing-vista-sp1/','2008-06-19 13:10:32','2008-06-19 20:10:32','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/19/installing-vista-sp1-follow-up/',0,'post','',0),(401,2,'2008-06-19 14:04:05','2008-06-19 21:04:05','<a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/03/05/IndefiniteHiatus.aspx\">Back in March Dare Obasanjo said he was going to stop blogging</a>.

I\'ve been getting into Python lately which has some really elegant support for anonymous functions, list/collection operations, and specifically things like map/reduce/filter. <a href=\"http://sebastian-bergmann.de/archives/750-Map-and-Reduce-in-PHP.html\">This is also an interesting approach on some similar techniques in PHP</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/06/19/DarkLaunchesGradualRampsAndIsolationTestingTheScalabilityOfNewFeaturesOnYourWebSite.aspx\">Dare also did an interesting post on techniques to dark launch / gradually ramp up new features</a>. The idea is that you want to try out a new feature without risking taking down your entire user base at once.\r\n\r\nSome other really simple approaches include putting a hidden iframe into existing pages that access the new feature. Its a really easy way to isolate it from the rest of what is going on for your site. One thing to keep in mind is that as you dark-launch a feature its really important to figure out how you can throttle it up/down. If you have 20 front end servers, maybe you can deploy it only on a certain set of them or else your pages can only serve it up a certain random percentage of the time. This way you can start it up on a very low load (say 1% of the requests) and slowly increase it to try it out more. If you start having some performance problems in your data center, just kick it down a couple of notches.\r\n\r\nDeploying to only certain specific servers can be especially interesting because it can (if done right) focus the load on those servers. So those servers behave the way the whole system will once the system gets fully turned on, but don\'t have the same risk of taking your whole environment down.\r\n\r\n','Recent Interesting Posts- Functional Programming and Dark Launches',0,'','publish','open','open','','recent-interesting-posts-functional-programming-and-dark-launches','','','2008-06-19 14:04:05','2008-06-19 21:04:05','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/19/recent-interesting-posts-functional-programming-and-dark-launches/',0,'post','',0),(402,2,'2008-06-20 18:57:32','2008-06-21 01:57:32','<a href=\"http://www.threeimaginarygirls.com/\">Cool site with focus on Seattle music happenings....</a>','Three Imaginary Girls',0,'','publish','open','open','','three-imaginary-girls','','','2008-06-20 18:57:32','2008-06-21 01:57:32','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/20/three-imaginary-girls/',0,'post','',0),(403,2,'2008-06-28 08:57:46','2008-06-28 15:57:46','For my media-PC I purchased a silent video card. Gigabyte makes the SilentPipe series for several of the Nvidia models and it seemed like a good idea to be able to get a card with decent graphical power (not top, but at the time it was better than any of the other cards I had) and no noise.\r\n\r\nThe catch is that when building a Media PC you need to keep in mind the overall system. The SilentPipe GF8600GTS has two problems- first of all its form factor is kind of big- the cooling fins stick about a half inch over the normal height of a PCI-express card. In a full sized case this would be fine but in the Zalman media-case I have there is only the exact room for full height cards and the extra half inch means the top of the case doesn\'t really fit right.\r\n\r\nThe second issue is heat. The card runs correctly, but overall it does run pretty hot and since its not blowing the hot air outside the case itself it places extra heat load on the rest of the system + relies on the existing case fans to create air moment through its fins and out its vent. I suspect this results in my overall case fans running higher more of the time, so in the end I fear that I\'m actually running a more noisy system for trying to use a silent video card. Instead of adding one relatively slow running video card fan I\'m pushing the main fans faster and higher RPMs create a lot more noise.\r\n\r\n','Silent Video Cards',0,'','publish','open','open','','silent-video-cards','','','2008-06-28 08:57:46','2008-06-28 15:57:46','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/06/28/silent-video-cards/',0,'post','',0),(404,2,'2008-06-29 21:37:11','2008-06-30 04:37:11','On Friday I finally got all the bits together for me new home RAID array.

Congrats to the team, and to Cisco/Linksys which is getting itself a fine group of people and some great technology. Pure was always in a complicated marketplace but it makes a ton of sense to me that an industry leader like Linksys would see Software as a great advantage in making Networking easier for their customers. Plus it makes me feel like my decision to buy that Linksys WRT600N a few weeks ago was the right one.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of which- so far the WRT600N is performing really well, and I\'m also using it with a WGA600N which is a dual-band N bridge that I\'ve got to hook up equipment downstairs (the XBox, the Wii and the TV). There are two main problems I\'ve had so far with the WRT600N. The first is that I named both my 5.4ghz and 2.4ghz networks with the same SID and its sometimes really unpredictable which network a given device has joined (and usually difficult to tell which one its connect to). This is partly a problem with the devices which don\'t really communicate well which band they are on, but the router could help a lot here too. Its really confusing to figure out which devices are going to work best on which bands (between trying to balance distance, penetration through walls and media-playback performance). Messing around with it sometimes my TV (which acts as a media extender) works with awesome HD capability and sometimes its just crap. This seems like one of those things some intelligent home network management software could help with (hint hint).\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem is that for some reason its tunneling isn\'t working. I love to use the remote access client to connect in to my home machines and I just can\'t get that to work with this router. I can\'t tell if its bugged or I\'m doing something wrong, but the interface to set it up is actually less intuitive than normal (which is saying something).\r\n\r\n','Cisco Acquires Pure Networks and Linksys WRT600N Impressions',0,'','publish','open','open','','cisco-acquires-pure-networks-and-linksys-wrt600n-impressions','','','2008-07-23 16:48:37','2008-07-23 23:48:37','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/07/23/cisco-acquires-pure-networks-and-linksys-wrt600n-impressions/',0,'post','',1),(407,2,'2008-07-28 00:47:59','2008-07-28 07:47:59','So I have a nice new storage array going for my home using the Sans Digital ESATA case, 4 WD Greenpower drives, and the Silicon Image ESATA card that came with the Sans Digital enclosure. The card comes with software called SATARAID5 that appears to mostly work just fine- it was easy to setup a RAID5 array with my 4 disks, and while I can\'t dynamically add more disks too it (it looks like there is some other newer software that supports that kind of thing), overall it works well with one major exception. Before I mention that I should add that I\'m just looking for some good reliable mass storage. This isn\'t a \"backup\", it doesn\'t need the highest performance storage possible (although faster is always better), and all that. I\'ve tested yanking a hard drive out of the array in mid-file copy and putting it back in later and it rebuilds (takes about 24 hours) but is fine.\r\n\r\nThe big catch is that everytime I reboot my system it does a rebuild- the management app has a nice UI that says that \"Group 0 Volume A was not shutdown properly\", and it kicks off the rebuild which takes a very long time. So far those rebuilds have worked great but its really annoying to have degraded performance and reliability after every reboot.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any experience with this stuff or ideas? Is there some way to manually shutdown the volume before I reboot? Some bug fix version that fixes this issue (I\'m running SATARAID5 version 1.5.2.1 on Vista 32-bit).\r\n\r\n','Silicon Image SATARAID5 and Reboots',0,'','publish','open','open','','silicon-image-sataraid5-and-reboots','','','2008-07-28 00:47:59','2008-07-28 07:47:59','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/07/28/silicon-image-sataraid5-and-reboots/',0,'post','',64),(408,2,'2008-07-29 22:25:00','2008-07-30 05:25:00','<a href=\"http://www.macworld.com/article/134632/2008/07/golfscoreapps.html?lsrc=rss_main\">MacWorld did a comparison of the golf-scoring apps for the iPhone and ranked TeeShot \"Best of the Bunch\"</a>.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.teeshotlive.com/\">TeeShot</a> is by my buddy Chris Evans and it rocks.

There is one that I didn\'t see there that I wanted to add.\r\n\r\nAs a startup its really important to set yourself some measurable goals and test your assumptions. To me we were never agressive enough about testing various questions like \"will people pay for an online show?\" in an unambiguous way. We had some pay shows but they were typically less known bands that would have a hard time pulling down a $5 cover-charge at the local small club. We could have booked a bigger band and just paid them some real money to do the show. Sure it would have cost some real cash, but the total amount would have been tiny compared to the burn rate we had at the time and we could have quickly answered the question.\r\n\r\nThere are some other similar things we didn\'t really test. Its very tempting to just push forward and try to build our your economics / business model, but if you aren\'t really tuning in to which marketing techniques work, how much various things really cost it takes a lot longer to get the right results.

This looks like a huge step forward in the standard model for ASP.net applications- a bunch of us have been ignoring much of the built in controls model and doing stuff similar to this for years, but the new version from the ASP.net team looks more elegant that what I\'ve been doing all along and there is always a big bonus when you are using the standard built-in stuff.\r\n\r\nI also think its worth pointing out that this stuff is some pretty good validation for the initial architecture of ASP.net. It feels like they did a really good job layering stuff so they had the basic runtime, the HTTP Handler level over that, the ASPX page model over that, and then a specific page processing / control action model. All along its been possible to take/leave various pieces, for example the urlrewriting.net stuff that plugged in and changed URL namespace stuff while the rest continued to work. Now they have evolved the architecture with a really new way to wire up pages, and its still consistent with the existing stuff and as far as I can tell doesn\'t break/change any of the basic architecture.

The discount sites often have similar laptops listed on sale for $399, so the mini laptop thing vs. low-end full laptop is pretty much a wash when it comes to cost.\r\n\r\nI think John\'s main point is probably that whether the base thing comes with linux or Windows, the main app is likely the browser and you can do amazingly well now with cloud-based computing and very limited local resources. In general I agree although its interesting to read <a href=\"http://crashdev.blogspot.com/2008/08/embracing-cloud.html\">Chris Devore\'s experiences trying to go all cloud-computing</a> and his more recent post <a href=\"http://crashdev.blogspot.com/2008/09/adventures-in-linuxland.html\">about it not working out so well yet</a>. This isn\'t to say that it couldn\'t work well for some situations but going 100% cloud ends up having some difficult implications that its hard to appreciate until you actually try it.\r\n\r\nI\'ve now worked with a number of startups that have most of their infrastructure cloud-based (GMail, Google Docs, Skype chat-rooms, Basecamp, etc) and compared to setting up all the typical office infrastructure this stuff is great. But it doesn\'t replace the kinds of things where having some local software can be very nice, and its also made any network connectivity issues especially painful. Both Judy\'s book and DeepRockDrive had occasional network outages in the office and when there were network problems people rapidly were 100% unable to get any work done. Bandwidth even becomes an issue- at DeepRockDrive we ended up with an office network with really poor bandwidth and when someone was trying to make a VOIP phone-call they would often have to ask the rest of the office to not use the Internet for a period of time.\r\n\r\nAll these things will improve with time, although fixing the network reliability issue will be the toughest nut to crack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Dell Mini',0,'','publish','open','open','','dell-mini','','','2008-09-08 10:08:25','2008-09-08 17:08:25','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/09/08/dell-mini/',0,'post','',0),(416,2,'2008-09-19 08:15:28','2008-09-19 15:15:28','I guess silly season is here in the financial markets now (in addition to politics where it started some time ago). Today\'s latest news is that the SEC is banning short selling in many financial stocks.\r\n\r\nThis is just about the stupidest thing I\'ve heard yet. Maybe they should pass a rule that stock prices are only allowed to go up while they are at it? Or just set the prices themselves?\r\n\r\nStock prices don\'t go down because someone is short selling. They go down because no one things that the current price is a \"good deal\". Lehman didn\'t collapse because some folks shorted it and complained about stuff- they collapsed because they lost billions of dollars in wacky speculative derivatives and then they tried to hide those losses on their balance sheets. The system is supposed to work because you have clear disclosure of whats going on financially with public companies, and if a company like Lehman is able to book a \"profit\" because no one trusts them and their debt has less value, that is just an amazing failure. That we found out about it when we did was because there were some folks who were motivated to investigate what was really happening here. Unfortunately that was NOT the SEC, even though that is supposed to be their job.\r\n\r\nSo in the end we have a classic situation. The SEC didn\'t do their job and let the investment banks go crazy. Especially crazy given that we should have already known after the failures of Longterm Capital (I\'m reading \"When Genius Failed\" right now), Enron and others. The same stuff was still going on, and they let it happen. But rather than admit that they are going off and trying to blame the folks who caught on to the whole mess.\r\n\r\n','Shooting the Messenger',0,'','publish','open','open','','shooting-the-messenger','','','2008-09-19 08:15:28','2008-09-19 15:15:28','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/09/19/shooting-the-messenger/',0,'post','',0),(417,2,'2008-09-20 21:54:10','2008-09-21 04:54:10','The other day I pointed out how stupid it was that they banned short-selling on various stocks. I could go into details, although many NY Times, WSJ and other articles have already covered this territory. But to just list a couple of issues-\r\n\r\n1) Do you prevent people from writing (naked) calls or buying puts?\r\n2) How do you deal with the fact that most financial firms routinely do paired long/short purchases as a hedging strategy (and in general this hasn\'t been responsible at all for the issues lately).\r\n3) How do you deal with the options market makers that routinely short stocks to hedge the short term risks as they write options? This issue is so serious that its rumored that the SEC is going to fix it on Monday and allow the options market makers to short stocks.\r\n4) Why those 799 stocks and not others? How do I get my favorite stock on the list of ones that you aren\'t allowed to short?\r\n\r\nIts all just clear evidence that its a bone-headed rule given that its causes a huge mess in the normal functioning of the market and has tons of unintended consequences. If you need to shut down the markets for a day or two so people can cool off, fine.\r\n\r\nI\'ve got to say that my initial read on the proposed $700B bailout plan is that its a really bad idea too. What this is supposed to fix is that people are complaining that the market for these crappy mortgage securities is illiquid since they can\'t find buyers for them. So the government is going to jump in and provide a buyer for these things. I\'ve heard some interesting analysis (sorry, don\'t have a link) that points out that they aren\'t actually illiquid- there are buyers, but the people holding them now just don\'t like the prices that the market would set for them. So rather than have the market set a fair price for these, the government comes in and buys them- but who the heck knows how the government is supposed to decide what an appropriate price is. The way its going to work is almost inevitably going to end up with a price much higher than would be fair (than the market would provide), this creating $100Bs of hand-outs to the people who created this mess in the first place.\r\n\r\nI mentioned that I\'m reading \"When Genius Failed\" about the failure of LTCM in 1998. I started reading this slowly a long time ago but recent events have me much more interested in it. Its amazing how similar everything is. There are two key themes that I see underlying both the book and current events in the financial industry.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, lots of the mess happens because we accidentally encourage people to take more risks than they should. When a fund makes tons of extra money on gains (but doesn\'t pay back losses presumably), and when many financial firms would bonus their traders in a similar way, it encourages really risky behavior since big short term wins can be a huge payoff. In a similar fashion, there are many instances of overall firms or the whole industry going down too risky ventures because they assume that if anything goes wrong there is going to be a bailout. This is what happened in 1998 when Russia was having all sorts of trouble- initially the G7 helped out and the market kept investing in wacky ways because they assumed that Russia (a nuclear superpower they kept pointing out) couldn\'t be allowed to default. This $700B plan + what has happened for several other companies in the last couple of weeks will just long term reinforce that companies should go for it, as long as they can entangle themselves enough with other players so they can\'t be allowed to fail.\r\n\r\nThe other key issue is transparency. Over and over part of the underlying problem is the ways that the financial companies have hidden what kind of deals they are really cutting, what their true leverage is (since many of the new derivatives contracts don\'t even count at all), etc. Now the financial firms have often said that they should have the right to protect their secret strategies and proprietary trading. Sounds good in theory, but for better or worse they have proven to us that the impacts of their failures and poor risk management spread well beyond just penalizing the management of their companies.\r\n\r\nHaving criticized the measures in place right now I feel like I should offer a suggestion of what we could do. I\'m not sure if its a good plan, but it does seem to have the one nice characteristic that probably just about every existing player in the financial industry will hate it equally.\r\n\r\nThe base principle is that the financial markets don\'t exist just as arbitrary entities for their own self enrichment. That\'s fine, but we have capital markets because they ideally provide our society with a very important function of providing capital needed for various activities (companies, municipal, government, etc), while providing a reasonable way for people to accumulate, preserve and protect their personal assets for retirement and life. The key mechanism of the market is ideally that it provide _fair_ prices for things, defined as what a buyer and seller would mutually agree to given access to reasonable information. Every specific from equities, bonds all the way to the strange derivatives just exist to re-enforce this. The strange derivatives can be really important- why not let someone trade a fixed interest rate in one currency for a floating rate in another one, if they want to reduce some business risk.\r\n\r\nGiven all the goals above, if you were going to create a new market, why not have a rule that 100% of all transactions need to be public. With modern computer systems you could have a flow of 100% of the billions of transactions that all go into the system and become accessible to anyone that wants to subscribe to the system (not necessarily for free, but at a reasonable cost that offsets just the expense of providing such a huge feed) on a 1 or 7 day delay. You can be free to pursue whatever strategies you want, but if you start shorting some company, you can\'t quietly do it for weeks without anyone noticing. If you figured something out you get a reasonable head start on everyone else taking advantage of it and can probably make a nice profit, but probably not a huge windfall.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile one of the things that LTCM did and seems to have happened again is that they did their business with tons of different firms to keep any other firm from getting a good view of what was going on. LTCM was leveraged 30-1 (50-1 later when they started suffering losses) but none of their partners could tell since they each had such a small view of what LTCM was doing. Its a very familiar pattern reading lots of analysis these past weeks. Firm A does a bunch of deals with all the other big firms around the industry, but because their partners don\'t see the details or big picture, they don\'t see how out on a limb Firm A really is and have know way of judging whether the transactions are reasonable risk or high risk. Then when Firm A collapses, it threatens to take down all its partners. If everyone else had seen what was really happening sooner, they would have had an opportunity to turn off the spigot before it got so bad.\r\n\r\nI\'m sure many folks in the industry would argue that they have the right to conduct their business strategies without their competitors watching. But for what its worth there are precedents that governments force companies to disclose things to the public, and this is hardly the first time when the current system has created huge bailouts (although I suspect its the first time the bill could hit $1T). Too much of the basic functioning of our society relies on these guys getting it right.\r\n\r\nFurthermore the SEC has proven to have no teeth to enforce things via the existing system of regulation. So to be clear, this data needs to be made available to the public, not just the government. I don\'t mean to imply that normal citizens will directly be able to use it, but there will be plenty of financial incentives to spot what kind of fishy stuff is going on and sell that information to interested parties (in effect similar to what the bond rating services do, but probably with much more real data).\r\n\r\n','Radical Transparency',0,'','publish','open','open','','radical-transparency','','','2008-09-20 21:54:10','2008-09-21 04:54:10','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/09/20/radical-transparency/',0,'post','',1),(418,2,'2008-09-23 08:36:50','2008-09-23 15:36:50','With all this fun talk of the $700B bail-out, I\'ve got two alternative ideas. Both I\'m sure are really bad for all sorts of reasons, but worth throwing out there anyway.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, has there been any talk of how we are going to PAY for the $700B? Traditionally taxes are often paired with the destination of their revenue somehow (in theory, although the reality is that its often BS). For example, your gas taxes often theoretically pay for transportation improvements. So why not add an extra 10% to the capital gains tax until the $700B is paid off. In theory capitol gains taxes are the ones most associated with the kinds of investment activity that was going haywire here. They are the ones that you pay on big profits you make on your house price going up (a source of capital gains revenue that I\'m sure will be much smaller for the next few years). They are also typically very unpopular with the Wall Street crowd, so it would be interesting to see how much support the bail-out has if paired with the capital gains tax increase.\r\n\r\nThe second (bad) idea goes like this. $700B is a lot of money. Really. What if instead of funneling it to the banking institutions you just wrote $70,000 checks to 10 MILLION home-owners that screwed up badly on their mortgages. Its not like either way we are talking about bailing out someone who was totally innocent here, but compared to the home-owners, the industry guys should have known better. With 10 million homeowners having an extra $70k in their pockets, it gives them opportunities to either sell their houses with the money helping with some of the losses, or give a cushion to make their mortgage payments for a couple of years, or whatever. Either way it should trickle-up and reduce the defaults on those loans, reducing the liability that the financial institutions hold, helping out the whole economy. Presumably you could create some system where the money has to go either to mortgage payments or house settlements to help avoid the \"go blow it all in Vegas\" problem somewhat. There would be no way to avoid certain kinds of abuses, but then again the \"give the bailout to the industry\" proposals have that same problem too. And yes, it is rewarding the people who screwed up but the existing proposal has that problem too. At least this way you give the opportunity for 10 million families to have a real shot at digging themselves out of a hole they got themselves into and I don\'t really see how the existing plan does that at all.\r\n\r\nThe big flaw with my second (bad) idea is that I think the folks proposing the $700B bail-out are assuming they are going to get some of their $700B back and that the real price-tag won\'t be that bad. But given that they haven\'t proposed any rational way to price the securities from the industry and that it doesn\'t seem like they are driving a hard bargain for equity and that the government seems like a poor choice of institution to manage the loans and efficiently collect on them, the notion that somehow we (the taxpayers) get our money back seems like a long shot.\r\n\r\n','Two Bad Ideas',0,'','publish','open','open','','two-bad-ideas','','','2008-09-23 08:36:50','2008-09-23 15:36:50','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/09/23/two-bad-ideas/',0,'post','',0),(419,2,'2008-12-15 14:22:51','2008-12-15 21:22:51','I\'ve been needing to finally get around to posting this.

They illustrate this with a web-based mail client Zimbra, but of course the first example with this was the Exchange 2000 version of Outlook Web Access.\r\n\r\nBack in 1999 this was one of the most difficult decisions that we needed to make as a team. Using DHTML we knew we could make a version of Outlook Web Access that looked and worked a lot more like Outlook did on Windows but should we? There was a strong argument made that we should instead design a new user interface that was much more web-like.\r\n\r\nFrom a purist point of view, going with the web-like user interface might have been the right approach. But one of the things that the Exchange team has always had as a real strength is the direct communication channel with our enterprise customers so we asked a bunch of them. The response was unanimous and strong- they all wanted us to make it look as close to the full Outlook as possible. Even with explaining the drawbacks (the browser\'s menu bar would be inconsistent, there would be this strange forward, backward and reload buttons), the enterprise IT managers who make the purchase and deployment decisions all felt that as much consistency with Outlook as possible would minimize their training costs and make it much easier for them to adopt the new technology.\r\n\r\nThe decision was wrenching for our team- at the time it felt like it was maybe one of those times to not listen to your customers and it was very frustrating to limit our design flexibility to copying the existing elements from Outlook. But in retrospect it seems like the decision paid off- that version launched Outlook Web Access into being a major part of the Exchange business and the customer reactions were very positive. In addition I\'d say that some of the \"uncanny valley\" drawbacks have diminished over time- browsers have evolved, getting rid of their own menu bars and other unnecessary UI that was causing some of the problems. Also the OWA team has done a great job improving the product to just work much more smoothly than it did back then and performance has increased, decreasing some of the uncanny effects (like slow responses to right-click and drag and drop).\r\n\r\nSo in the end, it depends. For many web applications building a new web-like user interface is absolutely the right thing to do. But if your application is really the partner to an existing one, consistency can be very valuable and can be worth some of the drawbacks. As both platforms have evolved over time they continue to converge making the whole issue less of a big deal.\r\n\r\nFinally I\'d argue that the classic \"uncanny valley\" effect is also mostly a gut-feel thing, and doesn\'t really apply in this case. Yes, the usability of a web application that tries to work like a Windows one might not be great, but it doesn\'t have that same sub-conscious uncanny effect the same way certain almost life-like computer graphics do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Uncanny Valley for User Interface',0,'','publish','open','open','','uncanny-valley-for-user-interface','','','2008-12-17 17:53:52','2008-12-18 00:53:52','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/12/17/uncanny-valley-for-user-interface/',0,'post','',0),(424,2,'2008-12-18 13:19:21','2008-12-18 20:19:21','This morning at about 5:30am there were two gigantic thunder-claps.

If the winds really hit that big, it would be a big deal.\r\n\r\nThe thing is, from reading the weather data, I don\'t see it.

You can scroll different time periods, and of course anyone reading this weeks from now all the old data will be gone.\r\n\r\nIn any case, what I see is a low pressure front coming in off the cost tomorrow afternoon/evening. I see some 50mph surface winds off the coast, but I don\'t see anything coming inland to Seattle more than 25mph. Also, while its a low, its not that strong of a low as such things go (989 mb). As it develops Sunday morning the strong winds will be to the SW of the low, well off shore. By the time the low comes on shore its 1001mb, which is hardly a low at all, and the winds are no big deal.\r\n\r\nThe only possible thing is that the pressure lines do stack up pretty tightly on the East side of the low which is right over Seattle.

So folks up in the mountains are going to get blasted, but down where most of the population is, it should be a normal storm.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in huge letters the Everett Hearld proclaims \"\'Mega-storm\' brewing\"... Cue the scary music.\r\n\r\nThe other strange thing is that the winds at 2000ft will be out of the East which is a really strange pattern for our area.

The Seattle schools started late Monday and Tuesday last week, and then were entirely canceled Wednesday. It didn\'t snow Wednesday, pretty much at all. Very wacky, although typical.\r\n\r\nThen Thursday it did snow for real. Not real by the standards of any place that gets real snow like Minneapolis or Ithaca, but Seattle just doesn\'t have the infrastructure to handle snow, plus it has lots of hills (a characteristic in common with Ithaca). So 3\" is pretty much enough to shut down the city and it was not a surprise when school was canceled Friday too, effectively starting winter break 3 days early.\r\n\r\nNow, at first this snow stuff is pretty fun. Stay inside, do some sledding in the streets, and walk everywhere without driving. Not that the amount of snow would be that much of a barrier to driving normally (both of our cars are AWD and I\'ve got a reasonable amount of experience with snow driving) but the other drivers around here scare the hell out of me. There are actually a few that have a clue, but the rest tend to be folks driving really inappropriate vehicles with no snow driving skills, or people who assume that because they are driving a 4WD they can cruise along at normal speeds on icy roads .\r\n\r\nThe former group can be pretty funny sometimes. We saw a woman putting chains on the back tires of her Civic. I could be wrong but I\'ve never heard of a Civic with rear wheel drive, and we tried to gently point out she might be doing the wrong tires but she was sure she had it right. Much more common are folks without chains and with cars really not meant for snow driving (think Prius). Typical behavior is getting stuck on an up-hill, and then gunning the engine, spinning the wheels, polishing the surface of the road into a nice glass-like ice. Fun.\r\n\r\nThen on Friday the big deal was the \"Mega Wind-Storm\" that was supposed to hit the area Saturday night / Sunday morning. Huge headlines across all of the papers, you couldn\'t watch a local news broadcast without tons of dramatic music and all that. Now, we have had some serious wind-storms before with most of the cities power being out for days, massive flooding, etc, so people had good reason to be a bit worried about the reports.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this case I checked out the aviation reports (see my previous post) and the strange thing is I couldn\'t really see anything that looked like a wind-storm. So to put it mildly, I was somewhat skeptical of the hype.\r\n\r\nHow did it turn out? I\'m going to claim that I was at least half right. In the city we had basically nothing- maybe 20mph winds for a couple of hours in the middle of the night. However there was a dramatic difference between the winds at the surface and those 2000\' up, and apparently some of the foothills communities did get some high winds, including an unofficial report of a gust to 100mph nearby. So there were high winds, but I\'m still going to claim that the press was irresponsible in not reporting the story in a way that made it clear that this was not going to impact 95% of the population of the area.\r\n\r\nOne last thought- now that its pushing a week of snow in the Seattle area, its getting a little old. Its probably hard to understand when you live in a place like Minneapolis or Ithaca where it snows in the fall, and pretty much stays around until April or later, but we just don\'t have any infrastructure to deal with it. The plow some of the major roads, but not very frequently and they don\'t even try to get them clear. They pile some snow in the middle of the road but the lane you drive on ends up having plenty of ice and snow anyway plus with only 1 real lane you get aggressive drivers trying to pass you in wacky ways if you are driving carefully. So it really becomes pretty hard to do any necessary errands which is cute for a day or two but gets old after a week. To be honest, I don\'t blame the city for this- we don\'t typically get weather like this, just a day or two, so its is pretty rare and it probably wouldn\'t make sense to prepare for such rare events. After all, one of the nice things about Seattle is that you can visit snow nearby, but you (typically) don\'t have to live with it every day.\r\n\r\n\r\n','Storm Conclusion (for now)',0,'','publish','open','open','','storm-conclusion-for-now','','','2008-12-22 14:01:40','2008-12-22 21:01:40','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/12/22/storm-conclusion-for-now/',0,'post','',0),(428,2,'2008-12-22 14:44:15','2008-12-22 21:44:15','<a href=\"http://www.crunchgear.com/2008/12/22/ea-to-release-games-on-valves-steam-completely-free-of-drm/\">This is big news- I can buy Spore and I think Mirror\'s Edge now (or soon)</a>.

Lets say you are developing a service with accounts and each account has a set of parameters associated with it- have they bought the service, how much storage do they have, how many user licenses, etc.\r\n\r\nNow, the set of things you want to store is going change over time for sure. So option 1 is to design a completely flexible system for storing key-value pairs-\r\nCREATE TABLE [AcctParams1] (\r\n [AcctId] [int] NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n [Key] [nvarchar] (16) NOT NULL,\r\n [Value] [int] NOT NULL\r\n)\r\nCREATE UNIQUE CLUSTERED INDEX [AcctParamsIdx] ON [AcctParams1] ([AcctId], [Key])\r\n\r\n\r\nA couple of notes before I move on. First of all its very important to create the clustered index on AcctId. You want to make sure that all the rows for the given account are grouped together on disk. If not, when the database goes to load just one account it might have to do IOs all over the place just to get the scattered AcctParam values.\r\n\r\nAs I said above, this approach is completely flexible, ideally involving no database schema changes ever. But the storage is somewhat less efficient and you are going to have to do multiple queries to retrieve everything you need about an account (one for the account itself, another for params).\r\n\r\nThe other way to do it is to just build out a table of the explicit columns for these parameters in classic database way-\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE [AcctParams2] (\r\n [AcctId] [int] NOT NULL IDENTITY,\r\n [Purchase] [int] NOT NULL,\r\n [UserLimit] [int] NOT NULL,\r\n [StorageLimit] [int] NOT NULL\r\n)\r\nWith this approach you need to change the database schema every time you want to add some new param. However I think sometimes people get too freaked out by database schema changes (often because of too painful \"upgrades\" in the past). For example if you just needed to do this-\r\n\r\nALTER TABLE [AcctParams2] ADD [TransferLimit] [int] NOT NULL DEFAULT 5\r\n\r\nOn modern databases this kind of thing tends to execute pretty quickly but most importantly if your code is written carefully you can run this on your SQL box while your service is still online without having to simultaneously update the code of the service. I did some examples and create the above table and put a million rows of random data in it (which took 229 seconds on my test box). The above ALTER TABLE took 7 seconds to execute.\r\n\r\nGuess what? We can do much better. Try this one-\r\nALTER TABLE [AcctParams2] ADD [TransferLimit] [int] NULL\r\n\r\nBy making it a NULL column it took... 0 seconds to execute. And again, if your app is built the right way, existing code will continue to work unchanged. So you can use a database schema that really defines the parameter names and types (in effect, SQL is handling the key-value stuff for you), but still has minimal upgrade impact on the uptime of your service.\r\n\r\nA third approach is to have something like-\r\n\r\nCREATE TABLE [AcctParams3] (\r\n [AcctId] [int] NOT NULL IDENTITY,\r\n [Params] [text] NOT NULL,\r\n)\r\n\r\nAnd stuff XML in the text column. Again, lots of flexibility, but you need to deal with all the XML parsing and it tends to be difficult to get the database to help you with any queries or analysis of that data. I\'ve also seen multiple efforts that went down this path and the XML parsers ended up inflexible enough that they actually introduced tons of inflexibility and upgrade hassle. If you need to touch every row to upgrade the XML on this approach you just made yourself a huge problem.\r\n\r\nOne last note that applies to either approach 2 or 3- you can combine these params in the base [Account] table. Whether you want to do this or not depends on the access patterns. If 90%+ of the time when you want to access one, you want to access the other (IE, you are always writing SELECT * from [Account] join [AcctParams] on [Account].[AcctId] = [AcctParams].[AcctId] ), you might as well combine them so that its always just one I/O. On the other hand if you often want just one or the other AND they start to get large (lots of values, especially to the point where it gets close to the page size), it can make sense to split them out. \r\n\r\nAs will all optimization, there are no hard and fast rules- just guidelines and good places to test alternatives.\r\n','Database Design',0,'','publish','open','open','','database-design','','','2009-01-06 17:04:59','2009-01-07 00:04:59','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=439',0,'post','',0),(440,2,'2009-01-06 17:04:34','2009-01-07 00:04:34','So here is a classic database design quandary.

The worst part is that it was very very difficult to tell what the difference was between models, but I ended up getting the slightly more expensive one at just less than $300. In today\'s printer market where the printers are almost free and they gouge you on ink, that is a fortune.\r\n\r\nMy first impression was that the footprint of this thing was huge- much bigger than I expected. It fits in the spot where my old printer was, but only by bulging out onto my desk an extra 6\" and getting a little in the way. I suspect this might have to do with various protrusions that are used to flip the paper for the duplex stuff. Setting it up I noticed a cool feature that old printers didn\'t have- the print head unit is replaceable- one of the big problems with my old Dell is that over time the print head has gotten gross so being able to replace it is a nice thing (even if at close to $50 it costs as much as many printers).\r\n\r\nThe ink is also in individual reservoirs for each color. Again, this gives you potential savings since you don\'t have to replace the whole thing the first time one runs out, but it also means there are 6 different things to replace at $15 each.

Still, it did work on the second try and I was off to software setup. The software setup took forever and a half and installed 300mb+ of crap on my machine and required a reboot, none of which are cool. I\'m using the printer connected to the network but it doesn\'t just work as a normal Windows network printer- you have to hook it up the first time on USB + Ethernet and then you can ditch the USB.

The most amazing thing to me is how wacky the press coverage has been, especially the people who should know better. The thing is, what Stewart is attacking is not just CNBC and the charlatans on the so-called cable \"news\" networks, but also the broader media itself that hasn\'t had the guts to say or do anything about it.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/14/arts/television/14watc.html?scp=4&sq=stewart&st=cse\">The New York Times TV critic posts a snarky thing about the show that totally missed the point</a>. Its not a boxing match, its not about two dueling personalities. Even the revelation during the show of the video clips of Cramer pretty much straight-out admitting to criminal market manipulation and encouraging others to do the same is not the most important bit (although it was also missing from most of the coverage). Its about the nature of media itself. Where has the NY Times been all along? I didn\'t get a chance to listen to the whole \"On the Media\" radio show this week, but the web-site doesn\'t give any indication that they paid any attention either.\r\n\r\nThe even deeper point is the extent to which the media has been falling down on their jobs of actually calling people on BS and lies. The \"present both sides of the story\" by printing quotes from a couple of people but in general have been amazingly lax about bothering to investigate, dig up any real facts, or make it clear when the quote from that CEO is just a lie.\r\n\r\nA great example is <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/15/business/15AIG.html?em\">today\'s New York Times article about the outrageous bonuses</a> that prints the quote from the A.I.G. CEO Liddy “We cannot attract and retain the best and the brightest talent to lead and staff the A.I.G. businesses — which are now being operated principally on behalf of American taxpayers — if employees believe their compensation is subject to continued and arbitrary adjustment by the U.S. Treasury.\"\r\n\r\nThat quote is presented unchallenged in the New York Times, but let me just pick at it for a second. To quote one of my favorite Saturday Night Live bits lately, Really? REALLLY?!? These are the \"best and the brightest\"? Really?!?!? These are exactly the same guys that just incurred > $200 BILLION in losses directly for your company (we still don\'t know the full extent because these guys are still hiding it in their accounting), these are the guys that already incurred a $170 BILLION tax-payer bailout directly, these are the guys that precipitated the worst crisis in decades, costing the US taxpayers over $1 TRILLION so far, costing the economy many times that. These are your \"best and brightest\"? These guys should be indicted for fraud and/or reckless negligence.\r\n\r\nBeyond my indignation, the reporter could have done some basic fact checking. Are $3 million bonuses really necessary to retain Wall Street guys in the current economy right now? If these guys were fired, would anyone even hire them? (\"lets see, on your resume, it says you worked for A.I.G. Let me call your references... You say you lost $100 billion in your last position?\") Frankly, from folks I know in the financial industry, most that still have jobs are just pretty happy to have them. And I\'ve heard the quality of the resumes that show up at any company that is hiring at all are through the roof. Trust me, if these guys are the sort that are just out for a quick buck and will quit if they don\'t get their big payday right now, A.I.G. and their shareholders, the US taxpayer (80% ownership) are much better off without them.\r\n\r\nEveryone is also taking at face value the notion that these guys have contracts that require the payments. I\'m pretty confident that their contracts have clauses that if they are fired \"for cause\", they aren\'t owed bonuses. If the contracts don\'t have that clause that would be pretty direct evidence that the contracts themselves were part of a fraudulent scheme to lock in a payday in anticipation of a government bailout, which again would void the contract. And let me just say that I\'m pretty confident that losing $200+ billion would count as a valid reason to get fired. I can just picture these guys trying to contest it as a improper termination in front of a jury (watch last week\'s Law and Order if you want an example of what that looks like).\r\n\r\nThe bottom line is that the mainstream press, all of them, just doesn\'t dig in on this stuff anymore and they accept the truthiness as a normal form of communication. We find ourselves in this strange position where Jon Stewart, the guy with the talk show on Comedy Central appears to be the only one we can rely on anymore.\r\n\r\n\r\n','In Stewart We Trust + A.I.G.',0,'','publish','open','open','','in-stewart-we-trust-aig','','','2009-03-15 22:59:03','2009-03-16 05:59:03','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=468',0,'post','',0),(469,2,'2009-03-15 22:49:37','2009-03-16 05:49:37','I\'m sure everyone has seen all the attention about the great Stewart vs. Cramer showdown on the Daily Show this week.

We have recently been getting into running as part of our plan to get into shape and our big goal is the Seattle Rock and Roll half-marathon at the end of June. Since we had never done a \"race\" before, we wanted to do a smaller one to get a feel for what its like being in a huge crowd of people before the bigger race.\r\n\r\nThe weather was miserable. It was 33 degrees and snowing which was the worst possible for the combination of cold + wet. Any colder and it wouldn\'t have been wet- just snow. Any warmer and it would have been, uh, warmer (and just as wet). We were jumping up and down trying to stay warm before the start and while getting going helped warm up some, my hands were still pretty cold and we were in no mood to hang out after.\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.seattlepi.com/photos/popupV2.asp?SubID=4695&page=1&gtitle=St.%20Patrick%27s%20Day%20Dash&pubdate=3/15/2009\">The Seattle PI (soon to be online only) has some good pictures to get a feel for what it was like</a>.

I was actually pretty happy that the 3.75 miles felt pretty easy for me, even with the slight uphill most of the first half. The crowd was pretty annoying. We were in the second wave where they still timed you, and followed some advice to start a bit back to avoid the main crush. I didn\'t mind the folks running at just about any speed, but the many folks who were walking (even after just a mile or so) felt like they were much more in the way. There were also a bunch of people pushing strollers which were supposed to be strictly against the rules in the section we were in. I\'m all for people working out that way, but in a race with 15,000 people it gets in the way of other people- get a baby sitter!\r\n\r\nThe other super annoying thing is that despite the timing chip that I believe can record start & finish times, they only posted the time from the starting horn which is pretty meaningless so the timing chip thing was a waste of time. I don\'t especially care about the time in comparison to other people, but I\'d like to have known what it was just for my own training goals.\r\n\r\nI think we might be doing the San Francisco Bay to Breakers to try out a bit longer race in May.

One can assume that the people inside knew by that point that something was horribly wrong and that it was likely the government was going to step in to help.

The fact that they have been spending the bailout money to resolve the companies obligations with their trading partners is not a problem- in theory, that is what the bailout has been for. But the reports are (again, with little real data, amazing lack of transparency given the situation, etc, etc), they have been cutting the worst possible deals and basically just handing over huge sums of cash to the other folks in the industry. Many of these positions were insurance on various bond offerings, where if the bond offering failed, A.I.G. would cover the losses. But what I\'ve read is that A.I.G. is paying out cash at 100% on the $ for these even in cases where the underlying bond is still fine. The analogy someone said was you buying fire insurance, and then the insurance company paying you off 100% even though the house didn\'t burn down.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The above together look like a bunch of guys who are not working in the interest of the company that pays them, or the shareholders (the tax payers) but rather cut themselves a sweet deal and are now handing out wads of cash to the very folks that are likely to be offering these individuals their next jobs.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe $165 million in bonuses itself isn\'t such a big deal, but for the recovery of the financial system to work, the people of the United States have to feel like we can actually trust the people fixing stuff to work on actually fixing it, not starting more fires.\r\n\r\nWhich leads to the biggest point and back to Jon Stewart vs. Cramer. I feel increasingly like a good chunk of the current world financial system is just a big scam. If you want to look at the \"big picture\", ignore Madoff and his Ponzi scheme, and consider that it looks like a big chunk of the financial industry is fundamentally corrupt and using their ability to hide what really goes on to collectively scam the whole of society. Let me stop for a second to point out that there are tons of people in the financial industry that are hard working competent people who are just doing what they can to provide access to capital, create markets with fair price discovery, and provide safe places for people to invest their savings. But the Stewart / Cramer confrontation just highlights the overall big picture that just about all the big firms (Lehman, Goldman, Citi, A.I.G), and a big chunk of the financial media were all participating in this system that wasn\'t about a well functioning market but was rather about coming up with some scheme to make .5% return on some obtuse derivative and then leverage it 60-1 into real money, and meanwhile go hype up some rumor on some stock (Cramer tries to blame the shorts, but there is just as much or more artificial boosting stocks for people who are long).\r\n\r\nAnd all of this was fueled by two key elements- a system that was fundamentally non-transparent, and short term compensation. The industry worshiped the notion that a good hedge fund (or private trading desk at a big bank) would come up with some proprietary system and would then do their trades with tons of different counter-parties so that no one could catch on to the system. But this also meant that there was no way for people to judge risk, no way to judge market saturation to the point of illiquidity (assuming that the \"system\" didn\'t rely on creating illiquidity in the first place to in effect corner the market on some obscure derivative which often backfired for example in the cast of LTCM).\r\n\r\nAnd that brings us back to the $165 million in A.I.G. bonuses. $165 million is nothing compared to the $10+ trillion Ponzi scheme that we fear we are all wrapped up in. But the reason that it IS important is that it does represent that the heart of what has gone wrong all along is still happening- short term windfall compensation and financial dealings that are not looking out for the interests of the right parties. It represents the erosion of fundamental trust in the system. It represents the fear that we won\'t be able to fix things without a major overhaul, that the core DNA of Wall Street, and many of the people that work there are fundamentally out of touch with what we need to maintain a stable, functional financial system that actually meets the needs of society.\r\n\r\nAs one last point, I\'ll say that I am concerned that the reaction of government in trying to fix this is going to be the wrong one. There is too much of a temptation to just create a bunch of regulation saying that you can\'t do this, you can\'t do that, and those kind of regulations will never keep up with the market and will strangle legitimate dealings. <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/09/20/radical-transparency/\">Back in September I suggested radical transparency for the financial industry</a> and the more this crisis has progressed, the more convinced I get that it would really represent the best solution (<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_reboot\">hey, even Wired jumped on my bandwagon</a>). If the deepest current problem is a trust issue, this kind of switch to full transparency becomes the only cure. The financial firms that rely on some proprietary trading scheme aren\'t going to like it, but those don\'t actually add to society- they just leach off it with very real and painful external costs (bailouts when they fail). \r\n\r\n','Prioritizing our Outrage (A.I.G and Jon Stewart)',0,'','publish','open','open','','prioritizing-our-outrage-aig-and-jon-stewart','','\nhttp://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/09/20/radical-transparency/','2009-03-21 11:02:00','2009-03-21 18:02:00','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=493',0,'post','',2),(494,2,'2009-03-19 07:54:10','2009-03-19 14:54:10','There have been <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/03/why_aig_story_is_so_hard_to_co.html\">several reasonable articles pointing out that our anger about the A.I.G. bonuses</a>, while probably justified, is probably not the best thing to be spending our attention on now.

I do think something should be done about the A.I.G. bonuses, again, because I think that while $165 million is just a drop in the ocean of the multi-trillion dollar crisis, I do think this goes to the fundamental credibility of whether the industry is set up to work in our societies best interest in fixing the mess they created, as opposed to continued short-term cashing out while the getting is still good.\r\n\r\nAlthough its obviously coming with its own set of political grandstanding, the approach taken by the NY Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo seems more reasonable. Rather than pass a law that has lots of side effects, we likely have plenty of existing laws that make a situation like this- executives signing contracts with each other that set up guaranteed payments, irrespective of job performance and from an (effectively) insolvent organization. I would hope that this would be sufficient to get the involved parties at A.I.G. to realize that its in their own self-interest to give the bonuses back, as well as make sure that similar situations will not happen again in the near future.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the one thing that I\'d love to see more of is scrutiny of the actual work that this group has been doing unraveling their toxic deals. Have they been using the government money to cut good deals in the interest of A.I.G. and its shareholders (the US taxpayer), or have they been doing their own sweetheart hand-outs to the other Wall St. companies like Goldman. Are they just paying out these insurance policies at 100% despite the underlying bonds still being in fine shape, or are they striking an appropriate hard bargain so that no one walks away unduly profiting from the governments assistance?\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/goldman-maintains-it-had-no-aig-exposure/?scp=2&sq=goldman&st=cse\">Goldman is still claiming they have no exposure to A.I.G.</a> but if that is true, among <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2214076/\">all the other government largess to Goldman why do they have more than $12 billion in payments from A.I.G. and other unwinding of these contracts</a>?\r\n\r\n','Unintended Consequences',0,'','publish','open','open','','unintended-consequences','','','2009-03-21 11:02:02','2009-03-21 18:02:02','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=501',0,'post','',0),(502,2,'2009-03-21 10:49:57','2009-03-21 17:49:57','There have been <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/03/why_aig_story_is_so_hard_to_co.html\">several reasonable articles pointing out that our anger about the A.I.G. bonuses</a>, while probably justified, is probably not the best thing to be spending our attention on now.

But the Stewart / Cramer confrontation just highlights the overall big picture that just about all the big firms (Lehman, Goldman, Citi, A.I.G), and a big chunk of the financial media were all participating in this system that wasn\'t about a well functioning market but was rather about coming up with some scheme to make .5% return on some obtuse derivative and then leverage it 60-1 into real money, and meanwhile go hype up some rumor on some stock (Cramer tries to blame the shorts, but there is just as much or more artificial boosting stocks for people who are long).\n\nAnd all of this was fueled by two key elements- a system that was fundamentally non-transparent, and short term compensation. The industry worshiped the notion that a good hedge fund (or private trading desk at a big bank) would come up with some proprietary system and would then do their trades with tons of different counter-parties so that no one could catch on to the system. But this also meant that there was no way for people to judge risk, no way to judge market saturation to the point of illiquidity (assuming that the \"system\" didn\'t rely on creating illiquidity in the first place to in effect corner the market on some obscure derivative which often backfired for example in the cast of LTCM).\n\nAnd that brings us back to the $165 million in A.I.G. bonuses. $165 million is nothing compared to the $10+ trillion Ponzi scheme that we fear we are all wrapped up in. But the reason that it IS important is that it does represent that the heart of what has gone wrong all along is still happening- short term windfall compensation and financial dealings that are not looking out for the interests of the right parties. It represents the erosion of fundamental trust in the system. It represents the fear that we won\'t be able to fix things without a major overhaul, that the core DNA of Wall Street, and many of the people that work there are fundamentally out of touch with what we need to maintain a stable, functional financial system that actually meets the needs of society.\n\nAs one last point, I\'ll say that I am concerned that the reaction of government in trying to fix this is going to be the wrong one. There is too much of a temptation to just create a bunch of regulation saying that you can\'t do this, you can\'t do that, and those kind of regulations will never keep up with the market and will strangle legitimate dealings. <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/09/20/radical-transparency/\">Back in September I suggested radical transparency for the financial industry</a> and the more this crisis has progressed, the more convinced I get that it would really represent the best solution (<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/magazine/17-03/wp_reboot\">hey, even Wired jumped on my bandwagon</a>).

The A.I.G. bonus thing represents a mere $165 million amid trillion dollar outrages. <a href=\"http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/03/simple_way_of_keeping_our_eyes.html\">As Planet Money (one of my favorite news sources lately) points out, shouldn\'t the President and Treasury officials be focused on the bigger issues</a>?\r\n\r\nBesides others point out, these contracts, while probably inappropriate are contracts, and isn\'t preserving the soundness of contracts more important than lashing out against these people?\r\n\r\nBefore I get to my main point, I\'d like to go over a few pieces of this situation-\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>It seems like these contracts were created in the time right during the collapse of A.I.G. before the government really stepped in. One can assume that the people inside knew by that point that something was horribly wrong and that it was likely the government was going to step in to help. From what we know right now (including that the current CEO says that he had no wiggle room to adjust the results) the contracts seem unduly beneficial towards the employees. <a href=\"http://www.avc.com/a_vc/2009/03/bonuses.html\">Fred Wilson wrote a bit about bonuses yesterday</a> and it just seems unheard of to be creating contractual bonuses that don\'t seem in any way related to actual performance, are short-term focused (in industries I\'ve worked, retention compensation gets paid out over a period of you staying for 5 years), etc. The problem is due to the amazing lack of transparency, we don\'t know the details of these contracts yet or how they got created or who they were given to or how those people performed, but presumably that is what Cumo is trying to find out. But it seems suspiciously like a bunch of guys, all with one foot out the door gave each other binding sweetheart deals in the moment before the government stepped in.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>I think it IS totally appropriate to shift some of the attention to how well these guys have performed rather than their personal payouts. The fact that they have been spending the bailout money to resolve the companies obligations with their trading partners is not a problem- in theory, that is what the bailout has been for. But the reports are (again, with little real data, amazing lack of transparency given the situation, etc, etc), they have been cutting the worst possible deals and basically just handing over huge sums of cash to the other folks in the industry. Many of these positions were insurance on various bond offerings, where if the bond offering failed, A.I.G. would cover the losses. But what I\'ve read is that A.I.G. is paying out cash at 100% on the $ for these even in cases where the underlying bond is still fine. The analogy someone said was you buying fire insurance, and then the insurance company paying you off 100% even though the house didn\'t burn down.</li>\r\n\r\n<li>The above together look like a bunch of guys who are not working in the interest of the company that pays them, or the shareholders (the tax payers) but rather cut themselves a sweet deal and are now handing out wads of cash to the very folks that are likely to be offering these individuals their next jobs.</li>\r\n\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\nThe $165 million in bonuses itself isn\'t such a big deal, but for the recovery of the financial system to work, the people of the United States have to feel like we can actually trust the people fixing stuff to work on actually fixing it, not starting more fires.\r\n\r\nWhich leads to the biggest point and back to Jon Stewart vs. Cramer. I feel increasingly like a good chunk of the current world financial system is just a big scam. If you want to look at the \"big picture\", ignore Madoff and his Ponzi scheme, and consider that it looks like a big chunk of the financial industry is fundamentally corrupt and using their ability to hide what really goes on to collectively scam the whole of society.

I do think something should be done about the A.I.G. bonuses, again, because I think that while $165 million is just a drop in the ocean of the multi-trillion dollar crisis, I do think this goes to the fundamental credibility of whether the industry is set up to work in our societies best interest in fixing the mess they created, as opposed to continued short-term cashing out while the getting is still good.\n\nAlthough its obviously coming with its own set of political grandstanding, the approach taken by the NY Attorney General, Andrew Cuomo seems more reasonable. Rather than pass a law that has lots of side effects, we likely have plenty of existing laws that make a situation like this- executives signing contracts with each other that set up guaranteed payments, irrespective of job performance and from an (effectively) insolvent organization. I would hope that this would be sufficient to get the involved parties at A.I.G. to realize that its in their own self-interest to give the bonuses back, as well as make sure that similar situations will not happen again in the near future.\n\nMeanwhile the one thing that I\'d love to see more of is scrutiny of the actual work that this group has been doing unraveling their toxic deals. Have they been using the government money to cut good deals in the interest of A.I.G. and its shareholders (the US taxpayer), or have they been doing their own sweetheart hand-outs to the other Wall St. companies like Goldman. Are they just paying out these insurance policies at 100% despite the underlying bonds still being in fine shape, or are they striking an appropriate hard bargain so that no one walks away unduly profiting from the governments assistance?\n\n<a href=\"http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/03/20/goldman-maintains-it-had-no-aig-exposure/?scp=2&sq=goldman&st=cse\">Goldman is still claiming they have no exposure to A.I.G.</a> but if that is true, among <a href=\"http://www.slate.com/id/2214076/\">all the other government largess to Goldman why do they have more than $5 billion in direct payments from A.I.G. unwinding these contracts, not to mention ','Unintended Consequences',0,'','inherit','open','open','','501-revision','','','2009-03-21 11:01:10','2009-03-21 18:01:10','',501,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2009/03/21/501-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(505,2,'2009-03-21 15:40:32','2009-03-21 22:40:32','Now that the iPhone 3.0 software is introduced, its time to start dreaming about what the next hardware might bring.

The financial services industry doesn\'t actually make anything. That doesn\'t imply that its bad or that the people who work in it are bad- there are lots of industries that don\'t make anything and yet are critical to the functioning of our society. Lawyers don\'t make anything, they help us make sure we have good agreements about how things get made. Politicians don\'t make anything, they create the rules that hopefully give us a level playing field for our society. Cops don\'t make anything- they enforce the rule of law so that people don\'t rip each other off or hurt each other. Each of these has a key role in the functioning of the overall society (and in making it possible for the other industries to function). But each of these can also have its own power-grab. If we were in a society where the politicians were just lining their own pockets with $10 million dollar bonuses and payouts and bribes or where the cops were doing the same thing I think we would scream bloody murder (and in fact we have when its been other countries where that happens). Each of these roles is expected to do its part and take an appropriate cut of societies resources for its role.\r\n\r\nSo what role does the financial services industry play? I can think of three key broad functions (and I\'m sure I\'m missing others)-\r\n1) It provides capital so that people that want to accomplish things whether creating companies, goods, or buying houses, can do so without inefficiently having to have all their own cash up front.\r\n2) It provides a stability and savings function. The combination of insurance and retirement savings and various off-shoots gives you a way to not just have to stuff cash in your mattress and live in fear that someone is going to steal it.\r\n3) It provides a pricing function that comes up with appropriate prices for capital, commodities, and other financial instruments.\r\n\r\nTo provide these functions the people involved in this industry are necessarily working with lots of money. But that doesn\'t imply that they are inherently owed 1% of whatever money passes through their hands. It doesn\'t imply that society should let too much of our effort (both money and human capital) go into serving that function, ESPECIALLY if by doing so it erodes some of the fundamental things that the financial industry provides (stability, efficient market pricing, both of which have gone to hell because the compensation system on Wall Street encouraged short-term risk taking).\r\n\r\nLet me give you an example that feels like it highlights this. The New York Times is reporting that the Fairfield Greenwich Group, one of the \"feeder funds\" that was investing in Madoff was paid 1 & 20% commissions on the money they invested for their clients in Madoff. To be fair, that is a fairly normal commission, although part of the presumption would be that the people earning that have done some serious due diligence into understanding how the money is being invested. So lets say you gave them $1000. After 3 years, they give you the great news that because Madoff is so smart your $1000 is now $2000. Oh, except that they kept 1% of assets under management each year (call it $45) and 20% of the profit ($200), so you only have $1755. Still, not to bad to make 75% gain in just 3 years.\r\n\r\nExcept that the underlying Madoff thing was all a fraud. But Fairfield still pocketed your $245. They took 25% of your money as a service fee to throw away the rest of it. To really understand how perverse this whole thing is, imagine Madoff did \"even better\". He turned your $1000 into $5000. 400% profit! Meanwhile Fairfield pockets ~$90 for their 1% and $800 for their 20% of the profit. The \"better\" the fraud does, the more all the financial industry guys line their pockets.\r\n\r\nEver wonder why the banks don\'t want to sell their toxic assets at real market prices (IE- what someone is willing to pay for them)? Why they were so eager to ditch the mark-to-market rules? The markets were up 4% today at one point on the relaxing of those rules. Basically that rule just lets them all keep playing the Madoff game and participate in the fantasy that the assets they hold have a higher value than they really do.\r\n\r\nWhich brings me full circle to the usual point I make in all these \"financial crisis\" posts lately. The only real solution, the only structural fix that would really work without imposing a web of complex \"rules\" that won\'t adapt nearly as fast as the people trying to get around them, is total visibility for all transactions. Again, this will piss off a bunch of the underlying folks in the industry, but the Madoff thing wouldn\'t have been able to happen. Various people will complain that it will be harder to make their huge profits using proprietary (and I\'m sure very smart) techniques, but the balance has to not be in favor of protecting the ability for folks to make a profit in an industry that is fundamentally a \"tax\" that we all pay for the functioning of society. Full visibility will accomplish the real societal goals of why we need a financial industry better than the existing slick trading systems do, it will do so at lower cost to society, and it does it without having to over-regulate the details of what transactions are allowed and which ones aren\'t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Free Market Outrage',0,'','publish','open','open','','free-market-outrage','','','2009-04-02 14:04:40','2009-04-02 21:04:40','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=509',0,'post','',0),(510,2,'2009-04-02 13:59:25','2009-04-02 20:59:25','I think part of the thing that is so weird about the big financial scandals this past year (other than that most are a complete replay of LTCM and other things from 10 years ago) are the sticky place that it puts someone like me who typically is a fan of \"free market\" mechanisms. <a href=\"http://theludwigs.com/2009/04/the-group-of-psychopaths-on-wall-street-whom-we-allowed-to-gang-rape-the-american-dream/\">John posted a link and an excerpt of a rant that I think expresses some frustration about just how off-the-rails those \"free market\" mechanisms seem to have gone</a>.\n\nWhich brings me to some thoughts about the whole role of the financial services industry.

The financial services industry doesn\'t actually make anything. That doesn\'t imply that its bad or that the people who work in it are bad- there are lots of industries that don\'t make anything and yet are critical to the functioning of our society. Lawyers don\'t make anything, they help us make sure we have good agreements about how things get made. Politicians don\'t make anything, they create the rules that hopefully give us a level playing field for our society. Cops don\'t make anything- they enforce the rule of law so that people don\'t rip each other off or hurt each other. Each of these has a key role in the functioning of the overall society (and in making it possible for the other industries to function). But each of these can also have its own power-grab. If we were in a society where the politicians were just lining their own pockets with $10 million dollar bonuses and payouts and bribes or where the cops were doing the same thing I think we would scream bloody murder (and in fact we have when its been other countries where that happens). Each of these roles is expected to do its part and take an appropriate cut of societies resources for its role.\n\nSo what role does the financial services industry play? I can think of three key broad functions (and I\'m sure I\'m missing others)-\n1) It provides capital so that people that want to accomplish things whether creating companies, goods, or buying houses, can do so without inefficiently having to have all their own cash up front.\n2) It provides a stability and savings function. The combination of insurance and retirement savings and various off-shoots gives you a way to not just have to stuff cash in your mattress and live in fear that someone is going to steal it.\n3) It provides a pricing function that comes up with appropriate prices for capital, commodities, and other financial instruments.\n\nTo provide these functions the people involved in this industry are necessarily working with lots of money. But that doesn\'t imply that they are inherently owed 1% of whatever money passes through their hands. It doesn\'t imply that society should let too much of our effort (both money and human capital) go into serving that function, ESPECIALLY if by doing so it erodes some of the fundamental things that the financial industry provides (stability, efficient market pricing, both of which have gone to hell because the compensation system on Wall Street encouraged short-term risk taking).\n\nLet me give you an example that feels like it highlights this. The New York Times is reporting that the Fairfield Greenwich Group, one of the \"feeder funds\" that was investing in Madoff was paid 1 & 20% commissions on the money they invested for their clients in Madoff. To be fair, that is a fairly normal commission, although part of the presumption would be that the people earning that have done some serious due diligence into understanding how the money is being invested. So lets say you gave them $1000. After 3 years, they give you the great news that because Madoff is so smart your $1000 is now $2000. Oh, except that they kept 1% of assets under management each year (call it $45) and 20% of the profit ($200), so you only have $1755. Still, not to bad to make 75% gain in just 3 years.\n\nExcept that the underlying Madoff thing was all a fraud. But Fairfield still pocketed your $245. They took 25% of your money as a service fee to throw away the rest of it. To really understand how perverse this whole thing is, imagine Madoff did \"even better\".

Basically that rule just lets them all keep playing the Madoff game and participate in the fantasy that the assets they hold have a higher value than they really do.\n\nWhich brings me full circle to the usual point I make in all these \"financial crisis\" posts lately.

A friend just booked a flight on American and they booked her through Dallas Fort-Worth with a 40-minute layover. Considering that they give your seats away 30 min before the \"flight time\", close the doors 20 minutes before the flight time, and that it usually takes a minimum of 15 minutes to get between gates there (30-40 if you don\'t do a full out run) this is crazy.\r\n\r\nI CAN\'T BELIEVE THESE GUYS ARE STILL IN BUSINESS. The only explanation is to again recall that these policies are designed to be intentionally consumer unfriendly by forcing you to miss flights and thus helping them avoid bump-charges.\r\n\r\nA few weeks ago we flew out to Washington DC. This time we took Alaska Airlines. So same pair of airports (Seatac, National). But the difference couldn\'t be more striking. The Alaska flights were non-stop. The airplanes were in good condition compared to the American ones. The staff was friendly and helpful- this guy had forgotten his day-planner at the check-in station, and not only did they make 3 announcements in the gate area for him, but they actually brought it down through security so he wouldn\'t have to run back to the check-in area and back through security. The cabin crew was nice, the pilots gave us helpful advice. And we were a few minutes late into Seattle so they asked people who didn\'t have connections to let the 17 folks with tight connections off first.\r\n\r\nNow, let me be clear. It probably doesn\'t actually make a real world difference. But if you are that person stressing about your connection, just the simple fact that the crew is expressing sympathy and a desire to help with your plight makes 1000% difference in how you feel about the situation. After letting the folks with connections off I thanked the crew as we left- they said that what they did was against policy. And its a shame that its against policy, but the more important thing is that their employees aren\'t taking their frustration out on customers and actually seem to recall they are in a service industry. They were friendly and helpful. And that makes all the difference.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','American Airlines Still Sucks',0,'','inherit','open','open','','376-revision','','','2008-04-03 18:49:30','2008-04-04 01:49:30','',376,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/04/03/376-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(556,2,'2009-09-17 08:33:03','2009-09-17 15:33:03','Sometimes when I get on <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/04/03/american-airlines-still-sucks/\">my usual rant about why certain airlines suck</a>, my friends getting sick of it seem to take the attitude \"of course they suck, there is nothing they can do about it\".\n\nBut as <a href=\"http://vcmike.wordpress.com/2009/09/01/virgin-america/\">Mike points out in a post about Virgin America</a> (and I\'ve had similar experiences with other airlines), you CAN do better.

The SSD is 100x more expensive per GB than the commodity SATA drive. But when you measure based on IOPS it is 6x cheaper. You would need 44 spindles of traditional drives to match the I/O performance of a single SSD. Before I go on, I should point out the measurements aren\'t apples to apples. The SSD measurement is write performance. The SATA performance varies a ton depending on the type of operations. Sequential reads and writes can be quite efficient while a SSD doesn\'t benefit from larger reads & writes beyond a certain point.\r\n\r\nIt is also interesting to observe that the SAS drives appear to never make sense. They are 50% faster than the SATA drives but they cost so much more that it is hard to imagine a scenario where they would be the right choice.\r\n\r\n \r\n \r\n','SATA vs. SAS vs. SSD',0,'','publish','open','open','','sata-vs-sas-vs-ssd','','','2009-10-28 14:00:00','2009-10-28 21:00:00','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=564',0,'post','',5),(565,2,'2009-10-28 13:49:56','2009-10-28 20:49:56','Was doing some analysis recently and I put together a simple comparison chart between commodity SATA drives, enterprise SAS drives and enterprise SSD.

It isn\'t as bad as it was in the old days when your system really got slower and slower and progressively less stable if you didn\'t clean it up.

At the time a 3ghz (overclocked to 3.66-4ghz) quad-core CPU with 4GB RAM was pretty much top of the line (unless you went to the server-class Xeon chips in which case you could use two quad-core CPUs for 8...) It is an interesting benchmark of the state of progress in the industry that while the shiny new Core i7 machines are indeed faster, they aren\'t enough so that I\'m really eager to build out a whole new system right away.\r\n\r\nStill there have been a couple of things that have been annoying me. My home workstation was still running Windows Vista and while I\'ve been increasingly using a Win7 VM on it, having used Windows 7 at work for a long time now I\'ve been eager to upgrade it. The other biggest concerns were that the main disk has been feeling really slow. Its one of the expensive faster \"Raptor\" drives, but its not that much faster and combined with the fact that I\'ve been running 32-bit Vista which sure seems to page a ton, and that the drive is so noisy you really hear it when its seeking all over the place, it has felt like a real dog.\r\n\r\nSo given that I\'m moving up to Windows 7, I bought myself two key upgrades- more RAM to take the system to 8GB (which with the 64-bit install of Windows 7 I plan should work nicely) and a SSD for my boot drive. NewEgg was nice enough to have a screaming black-friday deal on the 80GB X25Mg2 drive for $219 (down from the usual $279 or so) which was enough for me to pick one of those up right away. I kind of wish I\'d bought two so I had one for my laptop, but I\'m not quite going there yet.\r\n\r\nThe other big plan is to install Windows 7 in a VHD so that I\'ve got more flexibility to backup my OS image. I <a href=\"http://blogs.technet.com/keithcombs/archive/2009/05/22/dual-boot-from-vhd-using-windows-7-and-windows-server-2008-r2.aspx\">found some instructions here although I\'m not worried about the dual-boot thing</a>. I know some friends who are using dual-boot to have separate partitions for non-released stuff (beta versions of Office and other stuff) but I just run those in VMs and don\'t mess with different base OS images.\r\n\r\nThere was one big trick missing from the instructions for VHD install. When I went to setup Windows and selected the VHD disk it told me that the given partition was not supported for boot. Turns out that the \"Next\" button was enabled after all and the install worked just fine, so that warning just needed to be ignored.\r\n\r\nSo hopefully that should do it for now. I suspect it will be time to upgrade my video card (currently an ATI 3870) in a few months, although I\'m really hoping that they will come out with some that support 4-6 outputs on a single card (which is the rumor). Those of course might need new connectors (DisplayPort) so the scary part might be waiting on a new generation of displays.

This has seemed like a very exciting thing for quite some time- the idea of fairly low power, efficient, almost never burning out light sources seem like a great thing. But so far the results have been a disaster-they were fragile, didn\'t support dimmers, and the light quality was terrible- both very little light output, plus the colors were horrible.\r\n\r\nI think I can say that they are finally here and practical. I got a selection of several different ones at Home Depot over the holidays and put a few in and so far the results look great.\r\n\r\nProbably the start is the Home Depot\'s own brand the Eco Smart. At just $18 its far cheaper than the others, and its the closest to a normal lightbulb. $18 buys you a bulb with 429 lumens, equivalent to a 40 watt normal bulb, but it only uses 9 watts. I replaced a location that I had been using an existing LED and the results went from terrible to great- I can easily recommend it for anywhere you need a \"normal\" bulb that doesn\'t need to be too bright (no equivalents of 100 watts here).\r\n\r\nI also bought a few from Philips who appear to be making a big push in LED lights. I got 8 watt and 12.5 watt equivalents of normal bulbs and an indoor flood that is 12 watts. These cost quite a bit more at $22 for the 8 watt and $39/$49 for the 12 watt bulbs.\r\n\r\nThe flood is a bit weird- you can tell its a LED since it looks like it has a bunch of lenses on the front. The light quality is good though, just the bulb itself looks weird when you look at it. The \"normal\" two are even more strange when turned off- they look yellow when off, although when on it uses some special technology to create good looking white light. For exposed applications I feel like the Eco Smart looks better, but the 12 watt Philips looks like it can be a good fit in a recessed light fixture- it seems like it has some good openings for ventilation, but I do plan on keeping an eye on it to make sure it doesn\'t get too hot. When its on you can\'t really tell its at all different than the other lights.\r\n\r\nBest of all, they are all dimmable and unlike CF lights they turn on quickly and should have much longer lifespan.

One that is probably worth  sharing is the history of XMLHTTP.\r\n\r\nXMLHTTP has lately become a huge hit. It seems like people noticed it when  Google started using it in the <a href=\"http://www.google.com/webhp?complete=1&hl=en\">Google Suggest feature</a> and  they looked at the source code of that page to figure out how it worked. Google  had actually been using it earlier in GMail, but the JavaScript sources behind  GMail was much more complicated and people didn\'t notice it right away.\r\n\r\nSince then XMLHTTP and the \"AJAX\" (Asynchronous Javascript And XML) methodology have been mentioned in the Wall Street Journal and  <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/%3Ca%20href=\">CNET</a>  among other news sources.\r\n\r\nThe reality is that the client architecture of GMail appears to follow the rough  design of the Exchange 2000 implementation of Outlook Web Access for IE5 and  later which shipped way back in 2000.\r\n\r\nXMLHTTP actually began its life out of the Exchange 2000 team. I had      joined Microsoft in November 1996 and moved to Redmond in the spring of 1997      working initially on some Internet Standards stuff as related to the future of      Outlook. I was specifically doing some work on meta-data for web sites including      an early proposal called \"Web Collections\". During this time period Thomas Reardon       one day dragged me down the hall to introduce me to this guy named Jean Paoli that had      just joined the company. Jean was working on this new thing called XML that some people      suspected would be very big some day (for some unclear reason at the time).\r\n\r\nAfter I got the gist of XML, I switched my Web Collections proposal to take advantage of it      and published a \"W3C Submission\" entitled      <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/NOTE-XMLsubmit\">\"Web Collections using XML\"</a>. In retrospect      this is actually a fairly embarrassing document, but what can I say- back at the time \"push\"      was the hottest thing on the web and to the best of my knowledge this is the earliest published      public document discussing XML anywhere.\r\n\r\nThis led to me getting involved with some Microsoft folks who were working on the WebDAV       standard and I made a big push to move WebDAV to using XML as its model for communicating       data. Shortly after I joined the Exchange team which was just ramping up on Exchange 2000       to lead the development of Microsoft\'s WebDAV servers (which were implemented both on       normal IIS over the file system- DAVFS, and over Exchange data- DAVEX).\r\n\r\nI don\'t recall exactly when we started working on Outlook Web Access in  	Exchange 2000. I think it was about a year after I joined the team, probably  	sometime in mid 1998. In any case we were already a milestone or two into  	the Exchange 2000 (or \"Platinum\") project and had been carefully ignoring  	the issue of OWA mostly because the old version was such a hack. The old  	version had been written in a big rush by a pervious iteration of the team  	using ASP pages and was both fairly ugly and had huge server scalability and  	performance problems.\r\n\r\nAt some point Brian Valentine (who was still the GM of Exchange at the time)  asked us to figure out what to do with OWA for Exchange 2000. There were two  implementations that got started, one based on serving up straight web pages as  efficiently as possible with straight HTML, and another one that started playing  with the cool user interface you could build with DHTML. When I first got a demo  of the DHTML work that Jim Van Eaton and Bob Gering were doing I was just blown away.  However they were basically doing hacky form-posts back to the server and had  some of the same scalability and dynamic data problems of the old version.\r\n\r\nThat weekend (I think shortly before September 10th, 1998 which is the earliest date on the spec) I startup up Visual Studio and whipped up the first version of  what would become XMLHTTP. The first version didn\'t have async support hooked up  and was pretty crude, but it was enough to help Jim and Bob talk to some of the  WebDAV/XML support we had already built for Exchange 2000 and make some really  rapid progress with their DHTML OWA implementation.\r\n\r\n<h3>How we actually shipped XMLHTTP</h3>\r\n\r\nIt was one thing to have this cool component we could use to talk to the server, but we still weren\'t in any position to use it in the shipping  	product yet. The basic premise of Outlook Web Access was that you could walk  	up to any computer that had the browser on it and just get to your email. If  	we needed to download ActiveX controls, it was going to ruin the basic  	premise of the product, so the next step was to embark on shipping this  	thing in Internet Explorer.\r\n\r\nStep one was to bring the code up to production quality so we got Shawn  Bracewell, one of the devs on the OWA team to take it over. Being a smart guy he  promptly threw away all of my code and rewrote it in a more solid fashion,  adding async support, error handling and more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the IE project was just weeks away from beta 2 which was their last  beta before the release. This was the good-old-days when critical features were  crammed in just days before a release, but this was still cutting it close. I  realized that the MSXML library shipped with IE and I had some good contacts  over in the XML team who would probably help out- I got in touch with Jean Paoli  who was running that team at the time and we pretty quickly struck a deal to  ship the thing as part of the MSXML library. Which is the real explanation of  where the name XMLHTTP comes from- the thing is mostly about HTTP and doesn\'t  have any specific tie to XML other than that was the easiest excuse for shipping  it so I needed to cram XML into the name (plus- XML was the hot technology at  the time and it seemed like some good marketing for the component).\r\n\r\nWhile Shawn worked with Chris Lovett on the XML team to integrate with their  library, I covered the rest of the \"ship it\" bases and got sign-off from Joe  Peterson who was running IE at the time. We did a quick security review but at  the time no one really understood the seriousness or types of vulnerabilities  that anything shipping could cause. In terms of quality for the beta the theory  was \"no one other than OWA is going to try to call it so if it has a bug in the  beta, worst case we just can\'t use it.\" With a week to go before the beta we  checked it in, got a build and tried it out and everything looked great.\r\n\r\nThe beta shipped and the OWA team was able to start running forward using the  beta IE5, while Shawn fixed a number of bugs through the ship day of IE5. It  took us another year and a half to ship Exchange 2000, but this was one of those  cases where the little bit of planning ahead meant that by the time we shipped  the necessary bits were already pretty widely out there.\r\n\r\nActually shipping the thing required help from many more people that I\'ve mentioned      so far (and I\'m sure I\'ve forgotton others). Karim Battish and Sean Lyndersay were both involved at various times      keep the spec updated (which was written pretty much after the implementation, but sometimes      that is just how it works out) and working with partner teams. Chris Tyner was critical      on the test side- I\'m pretty sure without his energy and perseverance we would have      shipped the thing with numerous holes.\r\n\r\nIf I recall Chris made this killer HTML page that gave you a UI for sending arbitrary      HTTP requests. I think it was called \"DAVUI\" and it had templates for all      the common HTTP 1.1, WebDAV and special Exchange requests, and unlike the tool we had      been using before (that was a traditional Win32 EXE) you could just copy this one .htm      file to any machine or else run it remotely and it just worked. Brilliant.\r\n\r\nThere is a <a href=\"http://news.com.com/Web+tools+blaze+trail+to+the+past/2100-1032_3-5621010.html?tag=nefd.lede\"> 	new article on CNET</a> talking about AJAX / the Dynamic HTML + JavaScript + XMLHTTP      development methodology. It questions whether the AJAX approach diminishes the value of things      like Flash and Microsoft\'s Avalon / XAML. Having spent the past 4 years working on Avalon I      think this totally misses the value of Avalon and managed code. Building Outlook Web Access      was really really very very hard, and even so the results were not comparable to the real thing      (Outlook). You can\'t take it offline, you can\'t use it with multiple mail accounts in a coordinated      way, and the UI is just somewhat more clunky. This doesn\'t take away from the core value of OWA in      being something you can get to from anywhere. Still, the programming model and maintainability of the DHTML      approach was really difficult as the app got bigger. The beauty of many of the Google applications      is that they are really tight focused apps that don\'t try to do that much, but really take      nice advantages of the web characteristics. It seems like a false assumption to assume that this      approach will scale up for applications like Office. Avalon is based on a programming model      that is a big step up in terms of componentization and maintainability, plus it leapfrogs the      type of graphics, user interface and just plain experience you can deliver even with finely      tuned full Windows code.\r\n\r\nThe lesson to take out of this thing is to appreciate the importance of shipping and having the patience      to let something succeed. It feels like the press (and sometimes even the internal attitude)      about something like Avalon is to measure it by how many apps have adopted it on the launch day. That is      just crazy and it doesn\'t get the basics of how big a shift these sorts of things can be and how      long it takes to move the mind-set, learning, and deployment of a big new platform. I\'m convinced that      if Microsoft ships Avalon next year and Microsoft and the industry manage to stick to it and take the      long-term perspective, its going to be ubiquitous in 5 years. But it really does take a few years      before the actual momentum is there.\r\n\r\nThat was a great thing about working at Microsoft and I hope they still have it- the long term vision and ability to commit to things until version 3 when it really hits the mainstream. As a start-up we need to be constantly adapting, shipping very quickly and efficiently.\r\n\r\nI\'ve also got a few teasers online of new projects that I\'m working on. The image libraries   like <a title=\"airplane picture library with ajax zooming\" href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/view.php?p=airplanes\">this airplane picture set with AJAX based zooming and manipulation</a>  and <a title=\"CalendarData.com Calendar syndication, RSS feeds and subscriptions\" href=\"http://www.calendardata.com/\">my calendardata.com web site which helps syndicate calendar events</a> are some  to get started.\r\n<h3>Update- January 31, 2007</h3>\r\nAdam Bosworth gave a talk this week that was picked up in some of the press including <a href=\"http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,2088644,00.asp\">this write-up at eWeek</a> and again at <a href=\"http://developers.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/01/30/2217255\">Slashdot</a>. He talks about the early days of DHTML and Ajax and some of the Slashdot comments have picked up on his talking about having invented Ajax and suggested this conflicts with my <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/xmlhttp.htm\">Story of XMLHTTP</a> write up that has been carried in many online outlets lately.\r\n\r\nI\'ll weigh in and say that both are true. To the extent that there is some confusion its because what  we call AJAX today is a collection of many things- The basic dynamic  HTML infrastructure. The XMLHTTP & async network communication piece. And the patterns of tying it all  together.\r\n\r\nAdam and his team (especially folks like Rod  Chavez, Christian Fortini, <a href=\"http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=186137\">Michael Wallent</a> and many others, as usual I\'m probably forgetting to mention some of the key people) invented  the Dynamic HTML part which was miles beyond what Netscape was doing at the time. I just filled in the  XMLHTTP piece, and collaborated with many others to do the first major app that tied it together (Outlook  Web Access). Without the earlier contributions of the Trident/IE teams, it wouldn\'t have been possible, and  its absolutely true that Adam and many folks he worked with had the conceptual vision for tying it together  (he called it weblications at the time).\r\n\r\nHaving said that, they never built a real app with it and the act  of using it for real turned up some missing pieces, leading to XMLHTTP as well as several other things that  the Trident and XML teams themselves pioneered. I\'d also like to acknowledge the Adaptive Path guys for coming up with a nice description of the approach and giving it a word that wraps it up nicely (Ajax). At Microsoft we totally blew the opportunity to evangelize and get out in front of this approach back in 1999. That itself is a longer story for sometime in the future. I realize that some in the technical community are \"all about the engineering\" but effective marketing and communication of your ideas is important and we missed out on that.\r\n\r\nI do also think that Adam\'s discussion of why Ajax didn\'t take off in 1997 misses a key point. Sure, network connections were too slow at the time. The computers themselves and Javascript was too slow (recall that typical machines were 200mhz). The earliest versions of DHTML in IE4 had some.. er.. issues to work out (there was more than one reason that OWA required later versions of the browser). But most importantly I just don\'t think its realistic to expect the development community to make sweeping shifts to some new technology quickly. As I\'ve mentioned before these things take 3-5 years, so its not much of a surprise that the stuff that was developed incrementally between 1996 and 1998 actually started to hit it big in 2000-2002 and really exploded in 2005-2006.','Story of XMLHTTP',0,'','inherit','open','open','','110-revision','','','2008-03-03 20:36:13','2008-03-04 03:36:13','',110,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2008/03/03/110-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(611,2,'2011-11-17 11:32:26','2011-11-17 18:32:26','As with many others, I received my Kindle Fire yesterday and thought I\'d write up my initial impressions.

I\'m starting to feel like a bit of a masochist building my own PCs rather than just buying something nice off the shelf. A colleague asked me the other day why I build my own and sometimes its hard to actually figure it out.\r\n\r\nUltimately it comes down to being able to spec out exactly the parts that I want. I can get the exact processor, video card, dvd drive, hard drives that I want. When you buy from a vendor you have to deal with their choices which are often optimizing for very different things. They also tend to have weird pricing where certain crappy components are cheap but the ones you want are a huge upsell (SSDs are still in this category- they charge far higher than market prices for them when you configure one with a PC now). Also by buying pieces I can more easily roll over components that are still working fine from the previous PC.\r\n\r\nEither way the biggest pain is dealing with broken pieces. This is frankly where Apple has it nailed lately- bring your broken stuff into an Apple store for the first year and they just fix them (although sometimes you wait around for a year). Dealing with replacements and RMA shipping whether from Dell, HP or NewEgg is just a huge pain.\r\n\r\nFor components in general I\'m a big fan of NewEgg. Buying stuff from them is great, their prices are decent, they ship things quickly, and its easy to find the right stuff on their site. But when something doesn\'t work the RMA process can take hours to the point where I often just give up rather than try to get the component replaced (which I suppose is the point). I\'ve discovered you need to be careful about buying the components of a system early since after 30 days returns become an extra-nightmare. I bought a nice slim blu-ray drive for the Media PC but took more than a month to try it out. It turns out it was DOA. So I contact NewEgg. They say \"too late, contact the manufacturer for their warranty\". So I contact Sony Optiarc and they reply \"we are just an OEM, contact your retailer for warranty support\".

The idea is to build out as high end of a system as possible while staying within as small of a form factor as possible and not buying any of the extremely-expensive parts. This is my main workstation machine for my home office so I use it for coding, running VMs, browsing and playing games.\r\n\r\n<strong>Processor</strong>- for a brief window of time the Core i7- 2700K was the top of the line processor available. For some time Intel has always had a “top of the line processor” that cost close to $1000. But this past year the best processors have been under $400 so its been a fairly easy choice to get the high end one. Intel just came out with the new Core i7- 3960X that costs $1049, but that takes a new chipset and socket type and there aren’t any mini-ITX motherboards that support it. So I get to stick with the 2700K which is just as good for most games, and even better for most encoding tasks (since it has the on-chip GPU that can be used for encoding).\r\n\r\n<strong>Motherboard</strong>- There are really only two choices here. I wanted the Z68 chipset since it improved a bunch of things over the previous ones for a high-end system, and only Zotac and ASRock make motherboards in Mini-ITX form factors. The Zotac board I just couldn’t get to work. It fails pretty consistently on boot. I’ve tried it with multiple CPUs and RAM, so the problem is definitely the board. Also its impossible to upgrade the BIOS without booting to Windows (as far as I can tell) and since I can’t boot to Windows without crashing, that ends up being a pretty serious problem. The Zotac board has some nice video outputs, but they don’t matter for this system, and the ASRock adds an eSATA port which is really nice. The only problems I have with the ASRock board are that the eSATA port doesn’t support port-multipliers. I had been hoping to use it with an external Sans Digital 4-drive eSATA box, but it only shows one drive when I plug it in.\r\n\r\n<strong>RAM and Power Supply</strong>- I got both of these on New Egg “Shell Shocker” specials. No special logic for these other than that I wanted brands that are generally well known, I wanted 8GB of RAM (tempted to get 16GB but the 8GB DIMMS are still way too expensive) , and I wanted a “modular” Power Supply that lets you just connect the specific connectors that you need to reduce cable clutter inside the box.\r\n\r\n<strong>Graphics</strong>- I’ve generally liked the ATI/AMD boards lately and this one seemed to be this generations sweet spot of being able to drive 3+ monitors and give enough performance at 2560x1600 without being in the stratosphere of pricing and heat. This board seemed like it would be relatively quiet with decent cooling for the system which I was expecting to have a fairly crowded box.\r\n\r\n<strong>Boot Drive</strong>- I’ve been using an Intel X25M 80gb and the boot drive was getting a bit cramped. NewEgg had a killer sale on this OCZ Agility 3 and 240GB gives me plenty of room for boot-drive stuff. One interesting note- because my old system was on my old drive as a VHD, I was able to copy the VHD file over to the new drive using a “VHD Resize” utility, reinstall boot-loader stuff, and it made it fairly easy to just switch all my existing OS over to the new machine.\r\n\r\n<strong>Case</strong>- The Lian Li PC-Q08B case was one of the few choices in this range. I was looking for something that was as small as possible, but would still accommodate a full-sized video card. This case supports plenty of drives and overall ends up far smaller than what I had before. Overall the case was a pain to setup, but that usually goes with the territory when you are trying to build a smaller form-factor system (although plenty of big systems are a pain too). The way the USB3 ports on the front work are especially weird. They didn’t include a normal USB motherboard header (which the ASRock board wouldn’t have had anyway- the one advantage of the Zotac is it has extra USB3 ports). The front panel connectors just terminate in USB3 plugs that you have to work through the case and plug into the back. Instead I bought a small “internal” USB3 hub that can run off a standard floppy power connector and stuck it in my internal drive bay. Now, that thing is plugged into one of my back USB3 ports, but at least both of my front ports work and I still have one in back.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I’ll fill in more details about the various challenges putting this thing together shortly. The results appear great right now though- instead of taking up a huge amount of floor space, I have a small mini-tower in the corner of my desk. The CPU doesn’t exactly run cool (its ~40C at idle and maxes out at ~70C under high workloads), but its well within the expected limits. And best of all the overall result is acting very stable and is snappy fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Details of the New Desktop PC for 2011',0,'','publish','open','open','','details-of-the-new-desktop-pc-for-2011','','','2011-11-29 19:48:33','2011-11-30 02:48:33','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=616',0,'post','',3),(617,2,'2011-11-29 19:41:41','2011-11-30 02:41:41','<h3></h3>\n\nI’ve now completed building out the new desktop PC and thought I’d detail the hardware component choices I made.

I wanted the Z68 chipset since it improved a bunch of things over the previous ones for a high-end system, and only Zotac and ASRock make motherboards in Mini-ITX form factors. The Zotac board I just couldn’t get to work. It fails pretty consistently on boot. I’ve tried it with multiple CPUs and RAM, so the problem is definitely the board. Also its impossible to upgrade the BIOS without booting to Windows (as far as I can tell) and since I can’t boot to Windows without crashing, that ends up being a pretty serious problem. The Zotac board has some nice video outputs, but they don’t matter for this system, and the ASRock adds an eSATA port which is really nice. The only problems I have with the ASRock board are that the eSATA port doesn’t support port-multipliers. I had been hoping to use it with an external Sans Digital 4-drive eSATA box, but it only shows one drive when I plug it in.\nRAM and Power Supply- I got both of these on New Egg “Shell Shocker” specials. No special logic for these other than that I wanted brands that are generally well known, I wanted 8GB of RAM (tempted to get 16GB but the 8GB DIMMS are still way too expensive) , and I wanted a “modular” Power Supply that lets you just connect the specific connectors that you need to reduce cable clutter inside the box.\nGraphics- I’ve generally liked the ATI/AMD boards lately and this one seemed to be this generations sweet spot of being able to drive 3+ monitors and give enough performance at 2560x1600 without being in the stratosphere of pricing and heat. This board seemed like it would be relatively quiet with decent cooling for the system which I was expecting to have a fairly crowded box.\nBoot Drive- I’ve been using an Intel X25M 80gb and the boot drive was getting a bit cramped. NewEgg had a killer sale on this OCZ Agility 3 and 240GB gives me plenty of room for boot-drive stuff. One interesting note- because my old system was on my old drive as a VHD, I was able to copy the VHD file over to the new drive using a “VHD Resize” utility, reinstall boot-loader stuff, and it made it fairly easy to just switch all my existing OS over to the new machine.\nCase- The Lian Li PC-Q08B case was one of the few choices in this range. I was looking for something that was as small as possible, but would still accommodate a full-sized video card. This case supports plenty of drives and overall ends up far smaller than what I had before. Overall the case was a pain to setup, but that usually goes with the territory when you are trying to build a smaller form-factor system (although plenty of big systems are a pain too). The way the USB3 ports on the front work are especially weird. They didn’t include a normal USB motherboard header (which the ASRock board wouldn’t have had anyway- the one advantage of the Zotac is it has extra USB3 ports). The front panel connectors just terminate in USB3 plugs that you have to work through the case and plug into the back. Instead I bought a small “internal” USB3 hub that can run off a standard floppy power connector and stuck it in my internal drive bay. Now, that thing is plugged into one of my back USB3 ports, but at least both of my front ports work and I still have one in back.\nAs I said, I’ll fill in more details about the various challenges putting this thing together shortly. The results appear great right now though- instead of taking up a huge amount of floor space, I have a small mini-tower in the corner of my desk. The CPU doesn’t exactly run cool (its ~40C at idle and maxes out at ~70C under high workloads), but its well within the expected limits. And best of all the overall result is acting very stable and is snappy fast.\n\n\n\n\n\n','Details of the New Desktop PC for 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','616-revision','','','2011-11-29 19:41:41','2011-11-30 02:41:41','',616,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2011/11/29/616-revision/',0,'revision','',0),(618,2,'2011-11-29 19:41:49','2011-11-30 02:41:49','I’ve now completed building out the new desktop PC and thought I’d detail the hardware component choices I made.

This case supports plenty of drives and overall ends up far smaller than what I had before. Overall the case was a pain to setup, but that usually goes with the territory when you are trying to build a smaller form-factor system (although plenty of big systems are a pain too). The way the USB3 ports on the front work are especially weird. They didn’t include a normal USB motherboard header (which the ASRock board wouldn’t have had anyway- the one advantage of the Zotac is it has extra USB3 ports). The front panel connectors just terminate in USB3 plugs that you have to work through the case and plug into the back. Instead I bought a small “internal” USB3 hub that can run off a standard floppy power connector and stuck it in my internal drive bay. Now, that thing is plugged into one of my back USB3 ports, but at least both of my front ports work and I still have one in back.\r\n\r\nAs I said, I’ll fill in more details about the various challenges putting this thing together shortly. The results appear great right now though- instead of taking up a huge amount of floor space, I have a small mini-tower in the corner of my desk. The CPU doesn’t exactly run cool (its ~40C at idle and maxes out at ~70C under high workloads), but its well within the expected limits. And best of all the overall result is acting very stable and is snappy fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','Details of the New Desktop PC for 2011',0,'','inherit','open','open','','616-revision-5','','','2011-11-29 19:48:00','2011-11-30 02:48:00','',616,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2011/11/29/616-revision-5/',0,'revision','',0),(623,2,'2011-12-07 12:36:01','2011-12-07 19:36:01','Two quick updates on <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2011/11/29/details-of-the-new-desktop-pc-for-2011/\">the new desktop PC</a> before I get around to writing up more about the build process. First of all I mentioned in <a href=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/2011/11/29/details-of-the-new-desktop-pc-for-2011/\">the previous post</a> that I went with 8GB of RAM because the larger DIMMs were just to expensive. It turns out this is a perfect example of just how fluid the PC industry can be. Just a few weeks ago the only options to buy a 2x8GB RAM set cost more than $250, and last week NewEgg did a Shell Shocker for $99 which of course I snapped up. They are still more than 2x the price of 2x4GB sets, but since I love to run lots of things at the same time, run lots of VMs, etc, the extra RAM is really nice.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile I also read about how you can upgrade 2GB Radeon 6950 boards to 6970s just by updating the BIOS to enable the extra shaders. Since I have one of those this sounded great, so <a href=\"http://www.techpowerup.com/articles/overclocking/vidcard/159\">I followed the instructions over at TechPowerUp</a>. Er, except that I didn’t read all the instructions and missed the bit where for my board I was supposed to use a different tool RBE to update my existing BIOS instead of using the alternative BIOS they supplied. The result was a video board that hangs Windows anytime Windows starts up with the board installed and enabled. Luckily my motherboard has on-board video so I could use that but unfortunately the software that flashes the BIOS doesn’t work when the board is disabled in Windows.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the instructions on TechPowerUp show how you can easily fix these problems just by flipping a dual-BIOS switch on the board. So I look on my board and find the spot where the switch is supposed to be- the board has stenciled labels but I guess they cut costs by leaving the switch off. Grrrr.\r\n\r\nI finally solved this by <a href=\"http://www.vistax64.com/tutorials/191416-dos-usb-boot-drive.html\">making myself a DOS boot disk using these instructions</a> and putting the ATIFlash DOS utility on it. I was lucky I did follow the instructions about saving a copy of the old BIOS and that restored me to working state.\r\n\r\nProving that I’m a glutton for punishment I then tried the suggested technique of using RBE to update my existing BIOS. It didn’t seem to work for me- GPU-Z reported the same number of shaders and the machine seemed noticeably less stable. So I went back to the beginning and everything is running fine again.\r\nThen I put the new RAM in. The downside of a smaller PC case is that it can be a real pain to modify it in any way. To replace the RAM I had to remove the video board (since it was in the way of the RAM side-clips), and the power supply (since it blocks everything in this case). Luckily the power supply is fairly easy to remove since there are nice thumbscrews that let you pull it out the back without un-plugging anything.\r\n\r\nWith the new RAM in I start up the machine and ran the Windows memory diagnostics. I always like to do this with new RAM to make sure everything is ok, especially given how much of a pain it can be to return stuff after 30 days. Its really great that Windows 7 has built-in RAM diagnostics- you just hit F8 during boot up, then tab to switch the “page”, and then select the diagnostics.

Back then I would pour over the Apple ][ schematic and try to learn how that stuff worked and hook up simple circuits with TTL gates.

You can buy the Netduino which is an inexpensive 32-bit ARM microcontroller running the .NET Micro Framework, fire up Visual Studio, plug in the controller with an USB cable and hit F5 and its doing stuff. It has a bunch of I/O breakouts, and so you can build cool circuits from there. So far I made some simple light flashing things and a RGB LED controller that cycles the colors of a RGB LED and changes the cycle speed based on the setting of a pot. Next step is experimenting with some XBee controllers to do some simple mesh-networking. Part of the cool thing of those is it seems like simple functions can be wired directly to the XBee controller without needing a distinct microcontroller in each location.\r\n','Posts about Netduino',0,'','publish','open','open','','posts-about-netduino','','','2012-11-07 13:52:04','2012-11-07 20:52:04','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=646',0,'post','',0),(647,2,'2012-11-07 13:26:04','2012-11-07 20:26:04','I bought a Netduino a couple of weeks ago and am planning on posting about my experimentation with it (& other related stuff).

I’ve started playing with using XBee units to transmit a remote value of a light sensor, and it turns out the XBee units are based on their own microcontroller that has a reasonable amount of built-in functionality so you sometimes don’t need an additional fully programmable controller. Even more wacky, you configure the things with a variation of the good old Hayes AT command set, something that I’m more than familiar with from my modem days, but that frankly I was hoping to never see again.\r\n\r\nSo this project has two parts- a remote unit that just uses an XBee transmitter to read the value from a photo resistor, and a second XBee unit that receives the data and interfaces with a PC via USB. For this first attempt I’m using two XBee series 1 units, <a href=\"http://www.makershed.com/Uartsbee_V4_Xbee_FTDI_Adapter_p/mkseeed16.htm\">two Uartsbee interface units</a> and a breadboard.\r\n\r\nThe Uartsbee units are pretty convenient to get going at first with the USB interface, but their design as one big flaw. The XBee units themselves aren\'t compatible with breadboards since their pins have 2mm spacing instead of the .1”/2.54mm spacing that the breadboards use. The Uartsbee device however has its two rows of pins so far apart that if you put it in a breadboard it fills the entire width of the breadboard giving you no room to attach them to anything.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"http://www.alexhopmann.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/light-sensor.jpg\" />\r\n\r\nMy project was modeled after one in chapter 4 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596807732/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596807732&linkCode=as2&tag=lancairtalk-20\">Building Wireless Sensor Networks: with ZigBee, XBee, Arduino, and Processing</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lancairtalk-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596807732\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />. For this project I needed to wire the photo resistor to the analog input with connections to ground and +3.3v. However the necessary pins were on opposite sides of the board and I couldn\'t plug them in to my breadboard. The hack I did was that I configured IO pins 1 & 2 to be digital outputs and set one to low and one to high. That gave me the ground & +3.3v signals that I needed. I just used the USB connector for power, and that way didn\'t have to attach anything to the other side of the board. I did however have to hookup one additional pin that the book doesn\'t mention- they didn\'t show wiring to the vREF and I couldn\'t get it to work until I saw a reference to that in the <a href=\"http://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90000982_H.pdf\">XBee documentation</a> and attached +3.3v to vREF (pin 14).\r\n\r\nNext step was to configure the XBee units. I hooked them both up to USB and ran the XBee X-CTU utility twice. It showed me COM3 and COM4 and I used the terminal mode to hook up to each unit on a distinct port. The only configuration that was really required was on the “remote” unit- I hit it with-\r\nATD02    (analog input)\r\nATD15    (digital output high)\r\nATD24    (digital output low)\r\nATIR 3e8    (sample rate every 1000ms)\r\nATWR   (write configuration)\r\n\r\nAfter the ATIR command data started showing up on the “PC” side XBee- success!\r\n\r\nLast step is to write a program to read the data on the PC side. I was really happy to see that the drivers just made the output from the XBee show up as a serial port so I could just use System.IO.Ports.SerialPort to read it. The documentation on the packet formats were a bit confusing so I spent a little time decoding them and I still get packets that are a different size than I expected, but I got the whole thing working- code is below.\r\n\r\n<pre>\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.IO.Ports;\r\n\r\nnamespace XBeeBase\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            SerialPort port = new SerialPort(\"COM3\");\r\n            port.BaudRate = 9600;\r\n            port.Parity = Parity.None;\r\n            port.DataBits = 8;\r\n            port.StopBits = StopBits.One;\r\n            port.Handshake = Handshake.None;\r\n\r\n            port.Open();\r\n\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                while (true)\r\n                {\r\n                    byte[] buffer = ReadPacket(port);\r\n\r\n                    switch (buffer[0])\r\n                    {\r\n                        case 0x83:\r\n                            int sigStr = buffer[3];\r\n                            int options = buffer[4];\r\n                            int numSamples = buffer[5];\r\n                            int chanInd = buffer[6] * 256 + buffer[7];\r\n                            int value = buffer[buffer.Length - 3] * 256 + buffer[buffer.Length - 2];\r\n                            if (numSamples == 1 && buffer.Length == 13)\r\n                            {\r\n                                System.Console.WriteLine(\"Read str= \" + sigStr + \" opt=\" + options + \" len= \" + (buffer.Length-1) + \" num= \" + numSamples + \" chan=\" + chanInd + \" value=\" + value);\r\n                            }\r\n\r\n                            break;\r\n                        default:\r\n                            System.Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid input \" + buffer[0]);\r\n                            break;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            finally\r\n            {\r\n                port.Close();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        static byte[] ReadPacket(SerialPort port)\r\n        {\r\n            while (true)\r\n            {\r\n                int b = port.ReadByte();\r\n                if (b != 0x7e)\r\n                    continue;\r\n\r\n                int sizeH = port.ReadByte();\r\n                int sizeL = port.ReadByte();\r\n                int size = sizeH * 256 + sizeL;\r\n                byte[] buffer = new byte[size + 1];\r\n\r\n                int pos = 0;\r\n                while (pos < size + 1)\r\n                {\r\n                    pos += port.Read(buffer, pos, size + 1 - pos);\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                // Ignoring the checksum.

I did however have to hookup one additional pin that the book doesn\'t mention- they didn\'t show wiring to the vREF and I couldn\'t get it to work until I saw a reference to that in the <a href=”http://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90000982_H.pdf”>XBee documentation</a> and attached +3.3v to vREF (pin 14).\r\nNext step was to configure the XBee units. I hooked them both up to USB and ran the XBee X-CTU utility twice. It showed me COM3 and COM4 and I used the terminal mode to hook up to each unit on a distinct port. The only configuration that was really required was on the “remote” unit- I hit it with-\r\nATD02    (analog input)\r\nATD15    (digital output high)\r\nATD24    (digital output low)\r\nATIR 3e8    (sample rate every 1000ms)\r\nATWR   (write configuration)\r\nAfter the ATIR command data started showing up on the “PC” side XBee- success!\r\nLast step is to write a program to read the data on the PC side. I was really happy to see that the drivers just made the output from the XBee show up as a serial port so I could just use System.IO.Ports.SerialPort to read it. The documentation on the packet formats were a bit confusing so I spent a little time decoding them and I still get packets that are a different size than I expected, but I got the whole thing working- code is below.\r\n\r\n<code>\r\nusing System;\r\nusing System.IO.Ports;\r\n\r\nnamespace XBeeBase\r\n{\r\n    class Program\r\n    {\r\n        static void Main(string[] args)\r\n        {\r\n            SerialPort port = new SerialPort(\"COM3\");\r\n            port.BaudRate = 9600;\r\n            port.Parity = Parity.None;\r\n            port.DataBits = 8;\r\n            port.StopBits = StopBits.One;\r\n            port.Handshake = Handshake.None;\r\n\r\n            port.Open();\r\n\r\n            try\r\n            {\r\n                while (true)\r\n                {\r\n                    byte[] buffer = ReadPacket(port);\r\n\r\n                    switch (buffer[0])\r\n                    {\r\n                        case 0x83:\r\n                            int sigStr = buffer[3];\r\n                            int options = buffer[4];\r\n                            int numSamples = buffer[5];\r\n                            int chanInd = buffer[6] * 256 + buffer[7];\r\n                            int value = buffer[buffer.Length - 3] * 256 + buffer[buffer.Length - 2];\r\n                            if (numSamples == 1 && buffer.Length == 13)\r\n                            {\r\n                                System.Console.WriteLine(\"Read str= \" + sigStr + \" opt=\" + options + \" len= \" + (buffer.Length-1) + \" num= \" + numSamples + \" chan=\" + chanInd + \" value=\" + value);\r\n                            }\r\n\r\n                            break;\r\n                        default:\r\n                            System.Console.WriteLine(\"Invalid input \" + buffer[0]);\r\n                            break;\r\n                    }\r\n                }\r\n            }\r\n            finally\r\n            {\r\n                port.Close();\r\n            }\r\n        }\r\n\r\n        static byte[] ReadPacket(SerialPort port)\r\n        {\r\n            while (true)\r\n            {\r\n                int b = port.ReadByte();\r\n                if (b != 0x7e)\r\n                    continue;\r\n\r\n                int sizeH = port.ReadByte();\r\n                int sizeL = port.ReadByte();\r\n                int size = sizeH * 256 + sizeL;\r\n                byte[] buffer = new byte[size + 1];\r\n\r\n                int pos = 0;\r\n                while (pos < size + 1)\r\n                {\r\n                    pos += port.Read(buffer, pos, size + 1 - pos);\r\n                }\r\n\r\n                // Ignoring the checksum.

Even more wacky, you configure the things with a variation of the good old Hayes AT command set, something that I’m more than familiar with from my modem days, but that frankly I was hoping to never see again.\r\n\r\nSo this project has two parts- a remote unit that just uses an XBee transmitter to read the value from a photo resistor, and a second XBee unit that receives the data and interfaces with a PC via USB.

I’ve started playing with using XBee units to transmit a remote value of a light sensor, and it turns out the XBee units are based on their own microcontroller that has a reasonable amount of built-in functionality so you sometimes don’t need an additional fully programmable controller. Even more wacky, you configure the things with a variation of the good old Hayes AT command set, something that I’m more than familiar with from my modem days, but that frankly I was hoping to never see again.\r\n\r\nSo this project has two parts- a remote unit that just uses an XBee transmitter to read the value from a photo resistor, and a second XBee unit that receives the data and interfaces with a PC via USB. For this first attempt I’m using two XBee series 1 units, <a href=\"http://www.makershed.com/Uartsbee_V4_Xbee_FTDI_Adapter_p/mkseeed16.htm\">two Uartsbee interface units</a> and a breadboard.\r\n\r\nThe Uartsbee units are pretty convenient to get going at first with the USB interface, but their design as one big flaw. The XBee units themselves aren\'t compatible with breadboards since their pins have 2mm spacing instead of the .1”/2.54mm spacing that the breadboards use. The Uartsbee device however has its two rows of pins so far apart that if you put it in a breadboard it fills the entire width of the breadboard giving you no room to attach them to anything.\r\n\r\nMy project was modeled after one in chapter 4 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596807732/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596807732&linkCode=as2&tag=lancairtalk-20\">Building Wireless Sensor Networks: with ZigBee, XBee, Arduino, and Processing</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lancairtalk-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596807732\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />. For this project I needed to wire the photo resistor to the analog input with connections to ground and +3.3v. However the necessary pins were on opposite sides of the board and I couldn\'t plug them in to my breadboard. The hack I did was that I configured IO pins 1 & 2 to be digital outputs and set one to low and one to high. That gave me the ground & +3.3v signals that I needed. I just used the USB connector for power, and that way didn\'t have to attach anything to the other side of the board. I did however have to hookup one additional pin that the book doesn\'t mention- they didn\'t show wiring to the vREF and I couldn\'t get it to work until I saw a reference to that in the <a href=”http://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90000982_H.pdf”>XBee documentation</a> and attached +3.3v to vREF (pin 14).\r\nNext step was to configure the XBee units. I hooked them both up to USB and ran the XBee X-CTU utility twice. It showed me COM3 and COM4 and I used the terminal mode to hook up to each unit on a distinct port. The only configuration that was really required was on the “remote” unit- I hit it with-\r\nATD02    (analog input)\r\nATD15    (digital output high)\r\nATD24    (digital output low)\r\nATIR 3e8    (sample rate every 1000ms)\r\nATWR   (write configuration)\r\nAfter the ATIR command data started showing up on the “PC” side XBee- success!\r\nLast step is to write a program to read the data on the PC side. I was really happy to see that the drivers just made the output from the XBee show up as a serial port so I could just use System.IO.Ports.SerialPort to read it.

I’ve started playing with using XBee units to transmit a remote value of a light sensor, and it turns out the XBee units are based on their own microcontroller that has a reasonable amount of built-in functionality so you sometimes don’t need an additional fully programmable controller. Even more wacky, you configure the things with a variation of the good old Hayes AT command set, something that I’m more than familiar with from my modem days, but that frankly I was hoping to never see again.\r\n\r\nSo this project has two parts- a remote unit that just uses an XBee transmitter to read the value from a photo resistor, and a second XBee unit that receives the data and interfaces with a PC via USB. For this first attempt I’m using two XBee series 1 units, <a href=\"http://www.makershed.com/Uartsbee_V4_Xbee_FTDI_Adapter_p/mkseeed16.htm\">two Uartsbee interface units</a> and a breadboard.\r\n\r\nThe Uartsbee units are pretty convenient to get going at first with the USB interface, but their design as one big flaw. The XBee units themselves aren\'t compatible with breadboards since their pins have 2mm spacing instead of the .1”/2.54mm spacing that the breadboards use. The Uartsbee device however has its two rows of pins so far apart that if you put it in a breadboard it fills the entire width of the breadboard giving you no room to attach them to anything.\r\n\r\nMy project was modeled after one in chapter 4 of <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596807732/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0596807732&linkCode=as2&tag=lancairtalk-20\">Building Wireless Sensor Networks: with ZigBee, XBee, Arduino, and Processing</a><img src=\"http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=lancairtalk-20&l=as2&o=1&a=0596807732\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" alt=\"\" style=\"border:none !important; margin:0px !important;\" />. For this project I needed to wire the photo resistor to the analog input with connections to ground and +3.3v. However the necessary pins were on opposite sides of the board and I couldn\'t plug them in to my breadboard. The hack I did was that I configured IO pins 1 & 2 to be digital outputs and set one to low and one to high. That gave me the ground & +3.3v signals that I needed. I just used the USB connector for power, and that way didn\'t have to attach anything to the other side of the board. I did however have to hookup one additional pin that the book doesn\'t mention- they didn\'t show wiring to the vREF and I couldn\'t get it to work until I saw a reference to that in the <a href=\"http://ftp1.digi.com/support/documentation/90000982_H.pdf\">XBee documentation</a> and attached +3.3v to vREF (pin 14).\r\n\r\nNext step was to configure the XBee units. I hooked them both up to USB and ran the XBee X-CTU utility twice. It showed me COM3 and COM4 and I used the terminal mode to hook up to each unit on a distinct port. The only configuration that was really required was on the “remote” unit- I hit it with-\r\nATD02    (analog input)\r\nATD15    (digital output high)\r\nATD24    (digital output low)\r\nATIR 3e8    (sample rate every 1000ms)\r\nATWR   (write configuration)\r\n\r\nAfter the ATIR command data started showing up on the “PC” side XBee- success!\r\n\r\nLast step is to write a program to read the data on the PC side. I was really happy to see that the drivers just made the output from the XBee show up as a serial port so I could just use System.IO.Ports.SerialPort to read it.

I\'ve been a big fan of wings for a long time but its one of those foods that can be done so poorly the result is horrifying. The ideal wing for me needs to be really crispy on the outside so that it stays crispy when drenched in nuclear sauce, but still have nice juicy (but not under-cooked) meat.

Its one of those perfect situations for sous vide since you want to be able to cook the wing in as hot as possible oil so that it gets really crispy on the outside, but you don\'t want to over cook the inside or leave it in the oil so long it gets greasy. Many traditional recipes accomplish this by double-frying but sous vide ends up being much easier and probably healthier.\r\n\r\nI basically followed <a href=\"http://thezenkitchen.com/2012/02/sous-vide-chicken-wings/\">This recipe from The Zen Kitchen</a>. It was pretty straight-forward but I did want to add a couple of notes. First of all, I asked the butcher to cut the wings in half but forgot to get the \"tips\" cut off too, and didn\'t remember that until after I did the sous vide step. The tips were pretty easy to cut then, but ended up coming off with some of the meat since the already cooked wing was pretty tender.\r\n\r\nNext time I\'d also be more careful to try to get the wings in one layer in the vacuum bag, and after I took them out I\'d probably open the vacuum bag and drain them before refrigerating. Because I left them in the bags and refrigerated them overnight I had a ton of chicken fat and gelatin to scrape off them before frying. The volume of the stuff was amazing- certainly part of what probably makes this approach somewhat more healthy, given that 4 hours at 170F is going to render a ton of the fat. Would probably make a great base for a soup but we didn\'t have anything we wanted to do with it.\r\n\r\nThe frying went off without a hitch and then we tossed them in store-bought Franks Red Hot sauce. The resulting wings were so crispy they could be drenched in the sauce and still be crispy. As you bit in, they were still amazingly juicy too.

If you have decent equipment (doesn\'t need to be thousands of dollars, but a nice home vacuum sealer & temp regulator), sous vide can actually be quite a bit easier than other approaches and can have amazing results. The only extra complexity is that you often need to plan ahead a bit (I had to sous vide the night before) but if you can manage that, its really not at all difficult.\r\n','Sous Vide Buffalo Wings',0,'','publish','open','open','','sous-vide-buffalo-wings','','\nhttp://thezenkitchen.com/2012/02/sous-vide-chicken-wings/','2013-01-14 19:53:29','2013-01-15 02:53:29','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=659',0,'post','',1),(660,2,'2013-01-14 19:52:53','2013-01-15 02:52:53','Last Sunday I wanted to make some great wings for a marathon football day.

I\'m not entirely certain that people read blogs anymore here in mid 2015. But I\'ve been doing some cool stuff lately and I thought I\'d push myself to take some time to write about it periodically.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been at Valve for 15 months now and its been a pretty exciting place to work. Its the sort of place where you can pretty easily move around between projects to be taking care of the stuff that is important with the nice side effect that most of the time it stays pretty fresh. I\'ve done a bunch of stuff so far but the two main things so far are the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/news/15728/\" title=\"Steam Inventory Service\">Steam Inventory Service</a> and VR stuff (<a href=\"http://www.steamvr.com\" title=\"SteamVR\">SteamVR</a>, OpenVR, HTC Vive).\r\n\r\nMost of the fun stuff to share involves the VR stuff but today I\'ll just mention a couple of things about the Inventory Service. The PC games industry has been more vibrant than ever the past few years and we have been looking at ways to help enable developers to deliver even better experiences, hopefully focusing mostly on the gameplay and less on the extra stuff outside the game itself. Dealing with servers, databases, scalability and all those fun things are some of the things that can be challenging to deal with for all but the biggest game developers. With the Inventory service a game developer can add persistent items to a game without having to run any servers themselves. Further, if their game is successful we are already setup to handle massive scale on this service and its especially efficient for us to run it across the multiple games using it with Steam.\r\n\r\nDiving into game development has involved learning about some new types of problems. For example, its a pretty good assumption that any game will have its client code hacked at some point. So if you design something like the Inventory Service where the client grants items (\"you just killed an Orc so here is a magic ring\") people will be able to cheat. Some games might not really care about this, but for many the value in the items can often be their rarity. Players feel really special having gotten that extra rare item and if everyone can get it normal players will be unhappy.\r\n\r\nSo to combat this, we have a couple of modes you can use the Inventory Service. If you are running your own trusted servers, they can talk to our service to drop specific items. But in the case where you aren\'t running servers at all, the main safe way to drop items is via timed drops. Steam measures how much time you spend playing the game and after a specific amount of time you are eligible for a random item. If the game wants some semantics associated with that there can be different buckets of random items, but the key is that nothing the client can do can force a specific item.\r\n\r\n','What I\'m up to lately',0,'','publish','open','open','','what-im-up-to-lately','','','2015-06-06 13:10:53','2015-06-06 20:10:53','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=689',0,'post','',1),(690,2,'2015-06-04 07:49:49','2015-06-04 14:49:49','Its been awhile since I\'ve done anything on this blog.

It really feels like the good old days of first working with a mouse and trying to figure out this brand new thing and having to learn how users interact with it. Some of my colleagues have been working on this stuff for years and certainly have learned a lot but since real mass-audience commercial products are not really on the market yet its early to think you actually have the answers.\r\n\r\nThere are tons of controversial topics at the moment- performance requirements, issues around making people sick, input, interactions, APIs, support for multiple hardware platforms, and more. I’ll try to touch on a couple of these things, but keep in mind that while it’s a subtle distinction these comments are a bit more \"a few things we have learned\" rather than \"what we know\". And even more importantly I’m reluctant to say \"you need to do it this way\" because people are still inventing great ways to make stuff work.\r\n\r\nHaving said that I’ll touch on some performance stuff. A bunch of people were working at Valve for years development experimental hardware to try to understand the basic characteristics of what a VR system needs to really create a solid comfortable sense of presence. Of course there are lots of caveats and I’ll go into the details of what I think comfortable means but for me that means you need a display that updates at 90 frames per second with really solid tracking so that as you move your head the photons that hit your eyes really correspond to what would normally be happening as you move your head in the real world.\r\n\r\nHitting that 90 fps can be quite a performance challenge. When I’m playing games on my normal monitor I tend to prioritize beautiful rendering over frame-rate. I play on my 30\" monitor and crank up the quality settings and if the frame-rate ranges between 25fps to 50fps, fine. VR is a different beast- if you don’t hit 90fps consistently your users will feel sick. As they move the world won’t keep up with what the brain expects to see and for most people this can cause motion sickness which really ruins the experience. \r\n\r\nSo its critical that you hit 90fps. There are a bunch of techniques that game engines need to adopt to accomplish this since they traditionally have been designed to run at a fixed quality level with variable frame-rate. But there are also the questions about what hardware you need for this and its difficult to provide clear answers. Our demos at GDC all ran on a powerful gaming PC (although one that used normal parts) with a NVidia GTX 980 GPU. We wanted to show some high end experiences and preparing demos for an event like that doesn’t give you much time to optimize performance. But you could certainly run a bunch of great VR experiences on a machine with lower end parts. I guess the difficult part is just that its so hard to provide clear guidelines on what hardware you need given all the variables of the different kinds of content, how much optimization will happen before release and the need to hit that frame-rate with a lot of pixels consistently.\r\n\r\n','VR Topics and Performance',0,'','publish','open','open','','vr-topics-and-performance','','','2015-06-05 12:32:32','2015-06-05 19:32:32','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=694',0,'post','',0),(695,2,'2015-06-05 12:32:32','2015-06-05 19:32:32','The really exciting thing about working on VR at the moment is just how little we actually know.

Of course there are lots of caveats and I’ll go into the details of what I think comfortable means but for me that means you need a display that updates at 90 frames per second with really solid tracking so that as you move your head the photons that hit your eyes really correspond to what would normally be happening as you move your head in the real world.\r\n\r\nHitting that 90 fps can be quite a performance challenge. When I’m playing games on my normal monitor I tend to prioritize beautiful rendering over frame-rate. I play on my 30\" monitor and crank up the quality settings and if the frame-rate ranges between 25fps to 50fps, fine. VR is a different beast- if you don’t hit 90fps consistently your users will feel sick. As they move the world won’t keep up with what the brain expects to see and for most people this can cause motion sickness which really ruins the experience. \r\n\r\nSo its critical that you hit 90fps. There are a bunch of techniques that game engines need to adopt to accomplish this since they traditionally have been designed to run at a fixed quality level with variable frame-rate. But there are also the questions about what hardware you need for this and its difficult to provide clear answers. Our demos at GDC all ran on a powerful gaming PC (although one that used normal parts) with a NVidia GTX 980 GPU. We wanted to show some high end experiences and preparing demos for an event like that doesn’t give you much time to optimize performance. But you could certainly run a bunch of great VR experiences on a machine with lower end parts. I guess the difficult part is just that its so hard to provide clear guidelines on what hardware you need given all the variables of the different kinds of content, how much optimization will happen before release and the need to hit that frame-rate with a lot of pixels consistently.\r\n\r\n','VR Topics and Performance',0,'','inherit','open','open','','694-revision-v1','','','2015-06-05 12:32:32','2015-06-05 19:32:32','',694,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2015/06/05/694-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(696,2,'2015-06-06 13:09:54','2015-06-06 20:09:54','The topic of getting sick in VR (often called \"simulator sickness\") is a complex one. The simplified core of the issue is that when your visual perception doesn\'t match what your body (and especially inner ear) feels, many people feel sick. This is obviously not exclusive to VR- it can manifest in cars, airplanes, spaceflight, amusement park rides and more. Note that whatever the mechanism is for this in the brain isn\'t 100% tuned to all exact physical experiences. Many people get sick on a roller coaster even though their motion perfectly matches what they see- just the brain didn\'t evolve to be prepared for tight accelerating turns, changes in the gravity and so in those cases the mismatches between reality and brain-reality are enough to cause the problem.\r\n\r\nSome people even get sick playing first-person video games without VR. The types of motions in a typical FPS with lots of dashing around, quick turns, and strafing movements can be especially difficult for people who experiences these issues.\r\n\r\nIn VR I think of two main sources of mismatch between what your body feels and the photons entering your retina. Both can be equally important for VR experience designers to consider and both can be very complicated to get right. System-mismatch is the mismatch caused by the core VR technology. At some basic level a VR system is measuring your head\'s current position, velocity and acceleration and rendering a frame. Ideally that frame will be positioned so that it exactly corresponds to your head position at the moment in time the photons hit your retina. The other type is content-mismatch. This is by-design movement of the camera/head controlled by the experience that doesn\'t exactly match the player\'s physical movement.\r\n\r\nFor the fundamental technology we are working on at Valve we spend a lot of effort on system-mismatch. There are a number of techniques to address this, but they involve accurate tracking of head position, prediction of future head position, reducing latency in the rendering pipeline, deferring locking in head position in the rendering pipeline, adjusting rendering at the last minute,  making sure rendering actually makes framerate (since there is no worse added latency than missing a frame totally) and finally reducing latency between your GPU and the actual photons being emitted (HDMI has a fair amount of latency and this relates to why wireless displays are very difficult).\r\n\r\nAs I said, most of these are issues for the core VR system. As a content/experience/game developer there isn\'t that much you can do to change the tracking accuracy of whatever VR hardware you are using. Your main challenge is to never miss framerate. On the HTC Vive we run at 90hz so overall there are 11ms per frame. But there is plenty of overhead between various system things, the compositor, GPU scheduling, etc, so realistically you only have about 8ms to render your frame. It is critically important to design your content so that it fits within budget 100% (or at least 99.9%) of the time. Ideally game engines will help since its really hard to tune content to be consistent- most environments have something simple most of the time punctuated by some really complicated stuff occasionally (when all the explosions happen or something). If your game engine can automatically adjust and reduce render target sizes, AA, texture mips, etc, that can help a ton.\r\n\r\nContent-mismatch is however a more complicated issue. In general I\'m a fan of never making your players sick. Its true that there are some people who are less susceptible but its not clear to me that they are actually comfortable after spending a bunch of time in an experience that is questionable. I\'d love to do some research where we wire some of them up to HR, breathing, and other monitors and have them play an experience that pushes the boundaries for a full hour. Personally I\'m middle of the road- I\'m far from immune to getting sick but not nearly as bad as some. Part of what confuses some of the debate so far is that so few people have extended time in VR. When I\'m playing an experience that moves the camera I\'m usually fine for 2 or 3 minutes (typical demo length), feeling just a little \"off\" at 5 minutes and it doesn\'t get bad for a bit longer. But VR is still not going to be successful if 80% of people are feeling even a little uncomfortable after 5 minutes. They might not even realize they feel sick, but they certainly won\'t enjoy the experience the same way they would if they were in well designed experiences that didn\'t have these issues.\r\n\r\nWith all of the above preface, its useful to discuss what you can actually do. Most of the demos that Valve showed at GDC and since then had almost no forced-camera movement. We wanted to be especially careful to make sure people had great experiences while we are still learning what works. At this point I don\'t think we can definitively say that we know what works, but there are a bunch of techniques that look promising.\r\n\r\nIn general it seems fine to have the player in a slow-moving elevator with good visual references.

I\'m not entirely certain that people read blogs anymore here in mid 2015. But I\'ve been doing some cool stuff lately and I thought I\'d push myself to take some time to write about it periodically.\r\n\r\nI\'ve been at Valve for 15 months now and its been a pretty exciting place to work. Its the sort of place where you can pretty easily move around between projects to be taking care of the stuff that is important with the nice side effect that most of the time it stays pretty fresh. I\'ve done a bunch of stuff so far but the two main things so far are the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/news/15728/\" title=\"Steam Inventory Service\">Steam Inventory Service</a> and VR stuff (<a href=\"http://www.steamvr.com\" title=\"SteamVR\">SteamVR</a>, OpenVR, HTC Vive).\r\n\r\nMost of the fun stuff to share involves the VR stuff but today I\'ll just mention a couple of things about the Inventory Service. The PC games industry has been more vibrant than ever the past few years and we have been looking at ways to help enable developers to deliver even better experiences, hopefully focusing mostly on the gameplay and less on the extra stuff outside the game itself. Dealing with servers, databases, scalability and all those fun things are some of the things that can be challenging to deal with for all but the biggest game developers. With the Inventory service a game developer can add persistent items to a game without having to run any servers themselves. Further, if their game is successful we are already setup to handle massive scale on this service and its especially efficient for us to run it across the multiple games using it with Steam.\r\n\r\nDiving into game development has involved learning about some new types of problems. For example, its a pretty good assumption that any game will have its client code hacked at some point. So if you design something like the Inventory Service where the client grants items (\"you just killed an Orc so here is a magic ring\") people will be able to cheat. Some games might not really care about this, but for many the value in the items can often be their rarity. Players feel really special having gotten that extra rare item and if everyone can get it normal players will be unhappy.\r\n\r\nSo to combat this, we have a couple of modes you can use the Inventory Service. If you are running your own trusted servers, they can talk to our service to drop specific items. But in the case where you aren\'t running servers at all, the main safe way to drop items is via timed drops. Steam measures how much time you spend playing the game and after a specific amount of time you are eligible for a random item. If the game wants some semantics associated with that there can be different buckets of random items, but the key is that nothing the client can do can force a specific item.\r\n\r\n','What I\'m up to lately',0,'','inherit','open','open','','689-revision-v1','','','2015-06-06 13:10:53','2015-06-06 20:10:53','',689,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2015/06/06/689-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(699,2,'2015-06-06 13:39:42','2015-06-06 20:39:42','The topic of getting sick in VR (often called \"simulator sickness\") is a complex one.

On average they tend to have slightly better graphics than the typical PC because Apple controls the ecosystem and has always needed good baseline graphics performance to support the visuals in their OS.\r\n\r\nHOWEVER, quality VR is really hard to run on middle of the road GPUs. And to be clear, middle of the road in this case is not 50% of the performance of the high end (what you would see from a 970 or 980M). Its 10%. 70% of Mac gamers according to the <a href=\"http://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey?platform=mac\" title=\"Steam Hardware Survey\">Steam Hardware Survey</a> are running on laptops. And really no Macs at least as configured by Apple short of the $3999 MacPro models have enough GPU to make 90 frames per second with an HMD for any reasonably complex content. The new Retina 5k display iMac can be gotten with an MD Radeon M295X that should be good enough but that is over $2500 and doesn\'t even have an HDMI output so hooking up an HMD would need an adapter that might cause some interesting issues.\r\n\r\nBy comparison its pretty easy to build out a PC for about $1500 that has a top of the line Core i7 and a GeForce GTX 980 that should be equivalent to what we are using for demos. I should say that most of the PC OEMs don\'t make this easy at the moment- good luck for example finding a system on the Dell site with reasonable specs without getting a very expensive Alienware.

As usual there are several layers to the issue so some degree of confusion is pretty understandable.\r\n\r\nAt its most simple level VR support is provided by two key aspects-\r\n1) rendering a stereo view of the scene into two textures (or one texture with one eye on one side and the other on the other side) and handing that off to the VR api. At that point the VR API does a bunch of complex stuff including some corrections, distortion for its optics (which can be calibrated for individual devices) and composting additional system UI. But none of that latter stuff is something the app developers have to worry about.\r\n2) Updating the head position as the HMD is tracked. The underlying VR API should provide the game with a \"pose\" that represents the exact location and orientation of the head so that as you move your head around in the real world your view will exactly correspond.\r\n\r\nAt the above level it should be very easy for VR game authors to target multiple vendors headsets. If you are using Unity or Unreal Engine, support for both the Oculus and OpenVR SDKs are built-in / available with the addition of a simple plug-in. Better yet OpenVR is designed with a driver model for different hardware and our goal is to support any major HMD if you use it (although we are limited in our ability to promise specific support because vendors can change their APIs in breaking ways at any time and then we need to update).\r\n\r\nBeyond the basics of the headset and scene rendering are other issues around the interactions that the game supports. If your game doesn\'t use controllers and is a basic seated or simple standing experience, it should pretty easily work with any headset. In a similar fashion if you use non-tracked controllers like the Xbox or Steam controllers, anyone can buy one of those and use it with any headset. Tracked controllers become a more complicated problem- they each have some more specific behaviors and are tied to the specific tracking system. So in the short run, it would be hard to mix and match the controllers and if a specific game expects the HTC Vive trackpad input as part of its interaction, or another game is designed around the Oculus Touch specific features those might be harder to support across both platforms.\r\n\r\nOur goal with SteamVR/OpenVR all along has been to develop technology and make it available to others in the VR community so that we can have high quality VR that doesn\'t make people sick and where our customers can buy any VR equipment and enjoy their games on it. We hope Lighthouse will become a standard for tracking so that you can use controllers from many vendors (in many styles) to interact with all your games, but the OpenVR APIs can also work with non-lighthouse tracked controllers. Hopefully the VR industry can avoid following the early days of the 3d-accelerator market where games were created that only worked with one vendors hardware.\r\n\r\n','VR API support in Games',0,'','publish','open','open','','vr-api-support-in-games','','','2015-08-18 15:14:30','2015-08-18 22:14:30','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=711',0,'post','',0),(712,2,'2015-08-03 11:29:04','2015-08-03 18:29:04','Various recent discussions have been somewhat confusing about what it takes to add VR support to a game, and specifically what it takes to support multiple VR devices.

The Cloudhead guys discuss how they are showing some hints in game about the bounds of your real world space and I thought it would be interesting to discuss that in the context of the overall system.\r\n\r\nChaperone exists first and foremost to help people feel comfortable about moving around in room scale VR without having to worry about hurting yourself by running into something in the real world. One interesting aspect of this is that the chaperone system can really help the feeling of presence because once you get used to it you feel much more free to move around in your space. We do a ton of play testing and demos and pretty commonly see the first couple of minutes people move around with a lot of hesitation but once they get comfortable they let the experience they are in take over.\r\n\r\nWithin the chaperone system we think of two boundaries. The hard-bounds are the real limits of the physical space. If you are in an empty room, that would be the walls. If the room isn\'t empty it might be some artificial line that represents the furniture. But the point is hard-bounds are real \"do not pass\" line. Hard-bounds are implemented in the OpenVR system and when the player gets near them we will draw the shape of the room over anything the current experience is drawing right in the compositor. This is actually somewhat intentionally presence breaking. If you are about to collide with something we want to bump you out of the immersive experience right away.\r\n\r\nWe also tried experimenting with using just a partial wall in front of you for the hard-bounds to tone it down a bit. I didn\'t like that approach much because once I was getting into those limits I really wanted to see the shape of the whole room to help reorient myself.\r\n\r\nSoft-bounds however are another matter. Soft-bounds are another set of lines inset a bit from the hard-bounds and they really represent the space you should be inside most of the time when playing. When you are standing inside the soft-bounds, you shouldn\'t be able to easily wack things outside the hard-bounds. Soft-bounds aren\'t drawn by the system because we don\'t have a good way to do it automatically and keep you immersed in the experience you are in. However each experience can ideally represent the soft-bounds in some way that is consistent with its own look and that doesn\'t really disrupt your overall presence. One great example of this is TheBlu from WEVR. You are standing underwater on the deck of a ship and its safe to walk anywhere up to the railing in one direction and up to a bunch of junk and wires in the other direction. If your play-space is smaller they could pretty easily move the junk and wires so that the clear area of the deck still represents the safe space. Other games might need to use things like subtle glowing lines on the floor (as seen in the Cloudhead video).\r\n\r\nSo the key is- use subtle cues to give the player hints about the right place to play. And when they move outside those limits give them less subtle warnings to keep them safe and help reorient themselves in the space.\r\n\r\nThe Cloudhead video also shows some great ideas about dealing with virtual walls. Obviously in VR you can\'t prevent the user from moving the camera into some object just because its supposed to be solid in the virtual world. Remember that the camera IS their head, so if they move their head you have to move the camera. But it doesn\'t mean you can\'t do something about it. Now, sometimes its pretty fun to just let people put their heads inside your geometry and see the cool insides (people do this all the time with the robot in our Aperture demo and its a lot of fun). But if you don\'t want to allow that you can either blur or fade the world when they put their head into the object. I especially like the Cloudhead solution of teleporting you back to some safe place if you stay in there for a while- the problem with just fading or bluring is it can become disorienting to not have that visual reference so it can be uncomfortable or actually difficult to find the correct direction to back out.\r\n\r\nFinally I have head some reactions to the video of people expecting that the teleportation for locomotion will diminish presence. I\'m sure this varies a bunch from person to person but for me at least it ends up very natural. Its hard to describe but after using it for hours I end up actually teleporting around fairly quickly and my brain doesn\'t even think about it that much anymore. In contrast when I try a VR title that moves me around by gliding it feels very unnatural- something about the smooth motion seems wrong (and then I get sick and things feel even more wrong.. )\r\n\r\nIt all goes back to part of what is so exciting about working on VR right now- no one really knows the right way to do all this stuff. The space is wide open for people to come up with new ideas and test them to see what really works.','Cloudhead on Locomotion in VR',0,'','publish','open','open','','cloudhead-on-locomotion-in-vr','','','2015-08-11 14:33:17','2015-08-11 21:33:17','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=714',0,'post','',0),(715,2,'2015-08-11 14:33:17','2015-08-11 21:33:17','Cloudhead Games has some great ideas about <a href=\"https://youtu.be/DwZt2jRE8PY\" title=\"Locomotion in VR\">locomotion in VR in this video</a>.\r\n\r\nThis video brings up a couple of interesting topics worth discussing a bit more.\r\nThe first is about some details of the chaperone system.

Its hard to describe but after using it for hours I end up actually teleporting around fairly quickly and my brain doesn\'t even think about it that much anymore. In contrast when I try a VR title that moves me around by gliding it feels very unnatural- something about the smooth motion seems wrong (and then I get sick and things feel even more wrong.. )\r\n\r\nIt all goes back to part of what is so exciting about working on VR right now- no one really knows the right way to do all this stuff. The space is wide open for people to come up with new ideas and test them to see what really works.','Cloudhead on Locomotion in VR',0,'','inherit','open','open','','714-revision-v1','','','2015-08-11 14:33:17','2015-08-11 21:33:17','',714,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2015/08/11/714-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(716,2,'2015-08-18 15:14:30','2015-08-18 22:14:30','Various recent discussions have been somewhat confusing about what it takes to add VR support to a game, and specifically what it takes to support multiple VR devices. As usual there are several layers to the issue so some degree of confusion is pretty understandable.\r\n\r\nAt its most simple level VR support is provided by two key aspects-\r\n1) rendering a stereo view of the scene into two textures (or one texture with one eye on one side and the other on the other side) and handing that off to the VR api. At that point the VR API does a bunch of complex stuff including some corrections, distortion for its optics (which can be calibrated for individual devices) and composting additional system UI. But none of that latter stuff is something the app developers have to worry about.\r\n2) Updating the head position as the HMD is tracked. The underlying VR API should provide the game with a \"pose\" that represents the exact location and orientation of the head so that as you move your head around in the real world your view will exactly correspond.\r\n\r\nAt the above level it should be very easy for VR game authors to target multiple vendors headsets. If you are using Unity or Unreal Engine, support for both the Oculus and OpenVR SDKs are built-in / available with the addition of a simple plug-in. Better yet OpenVR is designed with a driver model for different hardware and our goal is to support any major HMD if you use it (although we are limited in our ability to promise specific support because vendors can change their APIs in breaking ways at any time and then we need to update).\r\n\r\nBeyond the basics of the headset and scene rendering are other issues around the interactions that the game supports. If your game doesn\'t use controllers and is a basic seated or simple standing experience, it should pretty easily work with any headset. In a similar fashion if you use non-tracked controllers like the Xbox or Steam controllers, anyone can buy one of those and use it with any headset. Tracked controllers become a more complicated problem- they each have some more specific behaviors and are tied to the specific tracking system. So in the short run, it would be hard to mix and match the controllers and if a specific game expects the HTC Vive trackpad input as part of its interaction, or another game is designed around the Oculus Touch specific features those might be harder to support across both platforms.\r\n\r\nOur goal with SteamVR/OpenVR all along has been to develop technology and make it available to others in the VR community so that we can have high quality VR that doesn\'t make people sick and where our customers can buy any VR equipment and enjoy their games on it. We hope Lighthouse will become a standard for tracking so that you can use controllers from many vendors (in many styles) to interact with all your games, but the OpenVR APIs can also work with non-lighthouse tracked controllers. Hopefully the VR industry can avoid following the early days of the 3d-accelerator market where games were created that only worked with one vendors hardware.\r\n\r\n','VR API support in Games',0,'','inherit','open','open','','711-revision-v1','','','2015-08-18 15:14:30','2015-08-18 22:14:30','',711,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/2015/08/18/711-revision-v1/',0,'revision','',0),(718,2,'2015-08-25 11:15:07','2015-08-25 18:15:07','I feel like I\'ll probably write a bunch about performance and VR as we go along since its such a complex topic and there is so much stuff we still need to learn. PC and gaming performance has always been an interesting topic but whereas in the past it was mostly about \"can I average 50fps or 55fps on this game?\" now it becomes \"can I consistently get 90fps 99.9% of the time so I don\'t get sick\". 100fps doesn\'t matter, 92fps doesn\'t matter, but 89fps just sucks. 90fps becomes a really sharp performance line.\r\n\r\nSo far we only have really preliminary performance data since it depends so much on the content and all of that is in-progress and hasn\'t really been optimized. People also haven\'t done the work to have their experiences scale up and down depending on the PC they are running on. For example with GPU performance you can do a lot by changing the size of the render target which is normally 1.4x the size of the real physical panels in each dimension (so a total of 1.96 times the pixesl). Having at least 1.4x scale gives you ideal anti-aliasing and sharpness when the panel distortion is applied but if you don\'t have enough GPU performance you could reduce that at the expense of some sharpness and graphical quality. Not ideal but it sure beats missing frames.\r\n\r\nIf CPU becomes the limiting factor your choices are a little more complicated. For one games are traditionally poorly multi-threaded and thus don\'t take good advantage of additional cores which is the main CPU performance improvement lately. When dual-core CPUs first came out most games didn\'t take advantage of them at all and while the situation has improved quite a bit recently few games seem to take full advantage of 4-core CPUs never-mind some of the 6-core machines that work great as development boxes (compilers LOVE 6-cores now!)\r\n\r\nOne of the issues in picking the ideal CPU is that CPUs are typically limited by their power consumption / heat generated. So a 6-core CPU is usually limited to much lower frequencies than a 4-core CPU. While it can have overall much more computing resources if the given task isn\'t able to keep at least 6 threads busy it will become gated on the performance of a single core which is higher in the chip with fewer cores. So I suspect for many gaming scenarios the high end 4-core CPUs will be better for now than the otherwise better 6-core ones until games can make better use of threads. I\'m looking forward to trying out the new Intel Core i7-6700k which is the new 4-core 4.0ghz Skylake CPU that should hopefully be the fastest yet for these scenarios.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n','VR Performance and CPUs- Cores vs Frequency',0,'','publish','open','open','','vr-performance-and-cpus-cores-vs-frequency','','','2015-08-25 11:15:07','2015-08-25 18:15:07','',0,'http://www.alexhopmann.com/?p=718',0,'post','',0),(719,2,'2015-08-25 11:13:33','2015-08-25 18:13:33','I feel like I\'ll probably write a bunch about performance and VR as we go along since its such a complex topic and there is so much stuff we still need to learn.

My old home workstation was using a Core i7-2700k and it just wasn\'t cutting it for some of the VR titles. On the one hand the old CPU was 4.5 years old and that should have been plenty of lifespan. By the old Moore\'s law the new CPUs should be 8x faster! Unfortunately we aren\'t still on that same curve. From the straight specs the CPU only progressed from 3.5ghz to 4.0ghz (with a max turbo of 4.2ghz) but overall depending on which benchmark you read you get an overall 27-45% boost in performance and probably a bit more headroom if you count overclocking.\r\n\r\nBefore I got into the details of my new workstation I wanted to mention that whenever I give advice on a PC build its always important to ask the person what they plan on using the PC for. If you don\'t have any real needs for graphics you can actually do great with some of the tiny PCs- for example the Intel NUC PCs are the size of a Mac Mini, cost ~$400 and can contain a Skylake (<a href=\"http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/nuc/change-the-game-with-nuc.html\">up to the latest generation core-i7</a>) CPU.\r\n\r\nEven if graphics/gaming is a big part of the use there is a pretty big spectrum of capabilities. For 90% of people building a nice small Mini-ITX machine with the new NVidia GTX 1070 is probably perfect. On the other hand if you want to drive games on a 4k monitor or do really high quality VR it might even make sense to prep for a system with SLI (dual graphics cards). You can have plenty of gorgeous VR experiences on a single GPU like last generations GTX 970 and indeed that is the target most games are aiming at now. But missing frames SUCKS. And even more VR can really be sensitive to aliasing and related issues. There are a lot of factors, but a good chunk of the root is just that can you move your head with such precision (and you can\'t keep it still) so many problems that traditional video games avoid because they control the camera show up. So this is just a long way to say that while I love tiny SFF machines I designed my new workstation to support SLI and hope to at some point equip it with dual-GTX 1080s.\r\n\r\nHaving committed to supporting SLI at some point that pushed me to a mATX motherboard instead of an ITX one. In some ways its kind of a shame- I\'m not aware of any technical reason why someone couldn\'t build a daughter-card for an ITX motherboard that had dual GPU slots and let you position them in some sensible way in the case. But I\'ve searched and that thing doesn\'t appear to exist.\r\n\r\nThe other issue that SLI raises is CPU family & chipset (this gets a bit complicated). The basic dilemma is that the Skylake processors like the 6700K use the Z170 chipset and the LGA 1151 socket which provides 26 I/O lanes. These are the high speed communication between the CPU and other devices. Modern GPUs all go in PCIe slots that have 16 lanes. Of course you can do the math pretty easily and tell that if there are two GPUs and only 26 I/O lanes they aren\'t each going to be able to use all 16. On the other hand the X99 which supports the LGA2011-v3 socket supports 40 lanes and so you can have dual GPUs each with 16 lanes on those systems. Unfortunately the CPUs for those sockets lag the mainstream ones by a bit- the new CPUs for the LGA2011-v3 socket called \"Broadwell-E\" should be releasing in a few weeks. There will be options that support 6, 8 and even 10 cores although those get incredibly expensive. Unfortunately as PC consumers we are left with trade-offs. Broadwell-E is a generation older and has lower frequencies (the 6-core one will run at 3.6ghz) which means less single-threaded performance. Of course they can make up for it by having a bunch more cores, but many graphics applications are ironically poorly threaded on the CPU-side. And they have those extra lanes so when they are running dual-GPUs they each get the full set of I/O.\r\n\r\nBut do the full 16 channels really make a difference? It took a bit of searching but I found <a href=\"https://www.pugetsystems.com/labs/articles/Impact-of-PCI-E-Speed-on-Gaming-Performance-518/\">some benchmarks from Puget Sound Systems</a> and from <a href=\"https://www.techpowerup.com/reviews/NVIDIA/GTX_980_PCI-Express_Scaling/\">TechPowerUp</a>. To skip to the conclusions the difference between running a GTX 980 at 8 lanes vs 16 is tiny. Dropping down to only 4 lanes or all the way down to PCIe 1.1 is measurable but the difference between x8 and x16 seems within the error-bars (PCIe 2.0 vs 3.0 also didn\'t appear to make much difference). The one caveat I\'ll mention is that this is looking at FPS during the execution of a game. Ideally a well-written game shouldn\'t be putting much load on the PCIe bus during runtime because hopefully all the big textures and such are already on the GPU. I do wonder if this would have a measurable impact on level-load time and/or games that are seamless when they have to load new content. With a PCIe 3.0 8x GPU having 4GB/s bandwidth it could take up to two seconds to swap out the entire 8GB of VRAM on these new cards. But another way to put it is that is 44MB per frame at 90fps so hopefully a game can stage loading those assets without glitching.\r\n\r\nThe other reason I wanted to go with the Skylake processor / Z170 chipset was I really wanted to get a PCIe M.2 drive for my boot drive and a USB-C port. Some of the X99 motherboards support these but as they are slightly older I was concerned the support wouldn\'t be as good. As it was I had to upgrade the BIOS on the motherboard I got for the M.2 to work correctly.\r\n\r\nOne other note on the build- I really wish I could have built this using the <a href=\"http://www.kimeraindustries.com/cerberus/\">Cerberus case from Kimera Industries</a>. It looks like an amazing design of a small case (smaller than most ITX cases) that can still fit a mATX motherboard. Unfortunately their kickstarter didn\'t get funded enough and they are still trying to figure out how to get production going. I ended up going with the <a href=\"http://www.corsair.com/en-us/carbide-series-air-240-high-airflow-micro-atx-and-mini-itx-pc-case\">Corsair Carbide Air 240 case</a> which I have to say I\'m very happy with so far. Good construction and all the panels came off which made it much easier to install components than any case I\'ve ever worked with before. I also like that it keeps the power supply and drives in a separated section from the motherboard- I\'m sure that helps with cooling a bunch but its even better for cable management. Of course its pretty big compared to the Cerberus (70% bigger!) but its not actually much bigger than the ITX case I had before.\r\n\r\nSo with all those details out of the way here is my current build-\r\n\r\nCase- Corsair Carbide Air 240\r\nCPU- Intel Core i7-6700K (4.0ghz LGA 1151 91W)\r\nCPU cooler- Corsair Hydro Series H50 1200mm Quiet edition (get the CPU cooled by a nice quiet 120mm external fan rather than the usual coolers that sit inside the case heat)\r\nMotherboard- ASUS ROG Maximus VIII GENE Z170 mATX\r\nRAM- G.SKILL Ripjaws V 32GB (2x16GB - I have 4 slots so I can upgrade to 64GB later if I want).

I went with Seagate Enterprise NAS HDD 8TB 7200RPM drives that I got on Amazon. The 8TB \"backup\" drive is quite a bit cheaper and to be honest has worked great so far. But having had an opportunity to hear a talk from a guy working for one of the drive companies I suspect some of the basic components upgrades to invisible things like the rotors, bearings, actuators and such should help with reliability.\r\n\r\nI\'ll try to post again soon with my more normal build\" recommendations.

Basically you need to specify in a config file the transform (offset and rotation) from the position of the controller attached to the real camera to the ideal focus point on the camera itself. You also need to specify that cameras \"FOV\" in a way that makes sense to a game engine.\r\n\r\nAt a basic level, we just created a test app that drew the virtual controllers and let you type keys to adjust the configuration in real time until they matched.

Overall its going well so far although I can easily peg my router (ASUS RT-AC66U) to the point where it can\'t route traffic although there is plenty of remaining bandwidth. The router is just a couple of years old and supports 802.11AC on both bands, but has a fairly puny CPU which just can\'t keep up. I\'ll post a bit more on my next router in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I\'ve been thinking a bit about the implications of having gigabit to the home. In retrospect this is all pretty \"duh\" but my home computer has a better connection to various cloud data centers than it does to the spinning disk enclosed inside its own box. I can do 1000Mbps or about 125MBps with ~8-12ms ping times to some of the commercial cloud data centers. While a 7200RPM spinning disk appears to be able to do around 200MBps (sequential reads) with about an 8ms latency. Ok, so the spinning disk wins by a little bit in this best-case scenario for it (it is down to ~75MBps for random reads and if you do 4k reads instead of 2MB reads it shrinks to ~0.3MBps).\r\n\r\nBut still, that is seriously close. My workstations typically have a smaller SSD for performance sensitive stuff (ok, I typically have 2 now, one for the boot drive and another for source code), and a bigger spinning disk for big things like videos, photos, games, etc. You could seriously remote that later application over the Internet and not really notice the performance difference.\r\n\r\nWhen I ordered my connection the sales person said that most people in my neighborhood were not opting for the full gigabit and that she frankly told anyone who didn\'t specifically ask for it that they don\'t need it.

Overall its going well so far although I can easily peg my router (ASUS RT-AC66U) to the point where it can\'t route traffic although there is plenty of remaining bandwidth. The router is just a couple of years old and supports 802.11AC on both bands, but has a fairly puny CPU which just can\'t keep up. I\'ll post a bit more on my next router in a couple of weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime I\'ve been thinking a bit about the implications of having gigabit to the home. In retrospect this is all pretty \"duh\" but my home computer has a better connection to various cloud data centers than it does to the spinning disk enclosed inside its own box. I can do 1000Mbps or about 125MBps with ~8-12ms ping times to some of the commercial cloud data centers. While a 7200RPM spinning disk appears to be able to do around 200MBps (sequential reads) with about an 8ms latency. Ok, so the spinning disk wins by a little bit in this best-case scenario for it (it is down to ~75MBps for random reads and if you do 4k reads instead of 2MB reads it shrinks to ~0.3MBps).\r\n\r\nBut still, that is seriously close.
