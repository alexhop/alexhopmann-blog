# Azure Quota Increase - Alternative Methods

Since you're unable to create a quota request through the portal, here are alternative approaches:

## Option 1: Direct Support Contact
- **Phone**: 1-800-MICROSOFT (1-800-642-7676)
- **Live Chat**: Available in Azure Portal under Help + Support
- Explain: "I have an MSDN Enterprise subscription with 0 quota for App Service VMs and need to increase it"

## Option 2: Azure Container Instances (No Quota Required)
Run: `./scripts/deploy-as-container.sh`
- Works immediately without quota increases
- Provides full Node.js runtime
- Costs ~$50/month for 1 vCPU + 1.5GB RAM
- Limitation: More complex custom domain setup

## Option 3: Try Azure Functions Premium Plan
```bash
az functionapp plan create \
  --resource-group alexhopmann_blog \
  --name alexhopmann-blog-premium \
  --location westus2 \
  --sku EP1 \
  --is-linux
```

## Option 4: Use Your Existing Static Web App
Your blog is already running at:
- https://kind-dune-00cb5791e.2.azurestaticapps.net

To add server-side features to Static Web Apps:
1. Create API functions in the `/api` directory
2. Use Managed Functions for authentication
3. Store dynamic data in Cosmos DB

## Option 5: External Hosting
Consider alternative platforms while resolving Azure quota:
- Vercel (native SvelteKit support)
- Netlify (with Functions)
- Railway.app
- Render.com

## Why is Quota 0?
MSDN subscriptions often start with restrictive quotas to prevent:
- Accidental high charges
- Resource abuse
- Compliance with licensing terms

The quota can be increased but requires support approval.
